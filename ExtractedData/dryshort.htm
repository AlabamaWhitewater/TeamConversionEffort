Notes:
Steep but somewhat forgiving, Dry is indeed dry unless big rain
graces the area. Any fast hard rain can bring it up, and not too much volume is needed due to the very narrow streambed.
You can't get there too long after the rain stops unless we've had over three inches or so. If Dry is running,
you can be semi-confident everything else on Sand Mountain is big. Dry is a fun run that is hard to catch because
it drops out so fast.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Dry is a quality micro-creek that will challenge and excite you without making you dance with the Grim Reaper.
It is one of my favorites and was the first steep micro run I ran way back when. Several slides and congested class
III+/IV- dominate the run. After the initial bushes, you'll run a shallow and somewhat long slide. Some tight and
twisty but pretty easy stuff then follows until you reach the big slide. You will recognize the big slide, I hope.
The big slide is at least 40' high total. It is fun. Starting far left and then ending up center seems to work.
If you allow yourself to go farther right, you may get some very cool airtime. Lower water descents have led to
serious back pain.  A pool is conveniently located at the bottom. Scout or walk on river right. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Below the slide the action is tight and constant with small pools and no rapids harder than IV, with one exception.
This is a class V- undercut rapid that is often portaged. Just above the V- rapid is a fun slide that pillows up
on a big rock on bottom right. Below the V- is a slide, then pyramid rock rapid after a short while. Many other
III and IV rapids follow. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Almost all the logs were chopped out of this in 1998, but they have finally returned by early 2009.  The lower
half of this run needs flossing pretty badly.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

A gage has been painted on the downstream side of the river right put-in bridge support. 0&quot; is just above
the bottom of a step on that support. 0&quot; would be pretty low but runnable, you might get down it with a shade
less. 4-6&quot; is very nice while 12&quot; is high. You can run it higher but you'll tend to wash from one rapid
to the next without a chance to consider the tree you are washing under. If it is too high, just wait a few minutes,
it'll drop out soon enough.
