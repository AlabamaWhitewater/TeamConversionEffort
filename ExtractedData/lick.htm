TRIP REPORT
Required Level:
400?
Notes:
Lick Creek falls under the category of &quot;with enough rain,
almost any arbitrary creek in Cullman or Blount County will have whitewater&quot;. OK, so gradient is nice too,
but this has some of that. Lick is a tributary to the Mulberry just outside Holly Pond. It only has what would
be probably be class II rapids at normal water but is rated class III because class III skills are required to
avoid logs and deal with high water. Lick is only recommended when there is plentiful water and more conventional
runs are blown out.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
Lick is fairly flat for the first mile or so. It does have two decent size drops of 5-7' in this stretch that are
unusual because they are formed by log jams, and they are runnable. This is part of the reason that this run needs
high water, so you can get over these drops safely. The run becomes a bit of a sluice ride farther down as it picks
up water from tributaries. Waves and holes abound, and due caution must be exercised for logs. Only a couple walks
are required, though. When you make it to the Mulberry, it may be so fast it will peel your eyelids back. The 0.9
mile float to the take-out is a short one, it took us about 8 minutes to get down it.
