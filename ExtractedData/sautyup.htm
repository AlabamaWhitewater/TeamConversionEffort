TRIP REPORT
Required Level:
800 (guess)
Notes:
The upper part of South Sauty is really not worth it. The first
two miles are pretty doggone flat, with an occasional medium to small surfing wave at about 5' on the (old) Bucks
Pocket gage. When Kirby comes in just upstream of the normal run put-in rapid, a couple almost river wide low head
dam type holes could ensnare the unwary. The usual put-in rapid is definitely the highlight. This could be a warmup
for the lower run but <A HREF="kirby.htm">Kirby</A> is much more entertaining for that purpose.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
The new gage is a decimal gage with 0' at 3' 6&quot; on the old gage. So now the old 4' is 0.5' and 5' is 1.5'.
