The 'Upper, Upper' (Upper, Upper Upper?) Mulberry is a delightful
class I, II, and II+ run. The run begins with class I shoals and simple rapids, and ends up with a few nice II+
rapids. Most everything is a straight shot. As of 2/13/2001, there was one log jam that could barely be avoided
and one or two other logs that you could go over with the Garden City gage around 6'. This run would be great as
an introduction to whitewater or for those seeking a mellower time. I think it is more interesting than the Upper
Mulberry. It is easier than the Locust but it has plenty of eddies to catch. The water moves throughout the run,
the longest pool is only a few hundred yards long. Several easy, fun front surfing waves are available, and a couple
holes could be surfed.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

5.0' is probably minimum, but take a look at the put-in. 5.5'+ is probably even better. We ran it as the gage went
from 5.5 up to 6.3 or so. The reading at Garden City has other tributaries such as the Duck adding their flow,
so this section should have about 1/3 or 1/4 the flow at G.C. Check to see if the other tribs are disproportionally
high.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The best place to park at Rt. 67 is the downstream river right side. A wide shoulder in front of a shop has a friendly
owner. Two people have gotten hurt using this put-in either by stepping on a wooden stub or falling onto a stump.
It is a steep rip-rap bank as I remember, so take your time and be careful.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

This run is relatively 'new' to the current Huntsville crowd but has been run many times over the last decades.
Kevin Baker used to put in a tandem canoe in various seasons of the year and run all the way to Garden City. The
run is around 20 miles, and he says sometimes they had to take out in the dark.
