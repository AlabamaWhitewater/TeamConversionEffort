TRIP REPORT

Notes:
I had looked at Roswell and even walked it years ago, but never
found the motivation to run it until recently. Sammy Peek did in 2009 at a very low flow. Roswell flows into the
Upper Upper Mulberry. It is very narrow with pretty steady gradient, few trees, a couple slides, some small drops,
but has a good many rapids considering the run is only 1 1/2 miles long. When you reach the confluence with the
Mulberry it is only 1 1/2 miles to Hwy 278. It shares the same watershed as Cotaco Creek, just the opposite side
of the mountain, so given the choice Sammy would rather be on Cotaco. Overall it is a good quick run to mix in
with something close by. With a good flow it would probably only take an hour to run. About half way down it crosses
Roswell Creek Rd.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

In 2010, we ran it at flood.  It was quite brief and somewhat stressful.  The Dalton Walker put in is easier than
AL67, but it really does not add any rapids and requires you to walk around a low water bridge.
