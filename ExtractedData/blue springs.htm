Notes:
This little stream drains the opposite side of the ridge from
Graves Creek north of Blountsville. It actually has its own gage, probably to see how much sewer water Blountsville
can pump into it. The creek starts out and ends up class II with nothing but class II in between. Some decent waves
may open up at higher water. Above the bridge it goes over what must be the remains of Chamblees Mill. It has pretty
decent gradient but does not do much with it. This would be a nice beginner or mellow water run given recent rains.
There are 5-6 logs across the creek as of late 2/2001, but they are all easy walks or scrape-overs. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Blue Springs peaks and falls incredibly fast. We ran it at 60, but 100 would be better. The gage is upstream
of the whitewater section on the western edge of Blountsville, so the actual flow where you run it is higher than
shown by the gage. It would be hard
to have too much water on this. It is probably a good indicator gage for <A HREF="graves.htm">Graves</A> creek, and may be useful for the <A HREF="calvert.htm">Calvert Prong</A> and
<A HREF="blackburn.htm">Blackburn</A> as well. The best place to put in is at the A-frame house where the road above the bridge over the stream curves
away from the stream, just as the mini-gorge begins. This adds 0.8 miles to the run, otherwise it is 1.25 miles
from the last bridge to the Mulberry. When you run this, the Mulberry will be high but mostly moving flatwater,
so it goes by quickly. There are one or two pretty fast and smooth big waves between the creek confluence and the
take-out.
