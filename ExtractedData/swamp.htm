Notes:
In my quest to learn more about <A HREF="socapatoy.htm">Socapatoy</A>
and <A HREF="weogufka.htm">Weogufka</A> Creeks, Brad Thompson told me about Swamp Creek from Hwy 22 to CR
29 (<A HREF="#low">Lower Swamp</A>). I checked it out. As I was scanning around the topos for the area,
I happened to see the word 'Rapids' and some relatively close elevation lines on the section above Hwy 22. Intrigued,
I checked out the aerial photos on the terraservice site. Sure enough, little trails of white could be observed.
Brad said &quot;the term micro would be an overstatement (usually dry?)&quot; for this stretch and he figured logjams
could be a major problem. Never that easily deterred, I put it on my to-do list.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
Swamp is indeed an enjoyable class I-II run with a relatively short section of fun II+ and III at about mile 2.5
or so. As of early 2005, logjams are not an issue at all. It would be a fun family paddle in the summer just after
a good rain. The creek is at its narrowest at the put-in and take-out, but has a fairly wide streambed for most
of the run. The first mile is quite flat and silted, but slowly the rocks begin to emerge until the fun mile begins.
There are one or two 5-6' high straight-on drops that would really make a tandem flatwater canoe run entertaining.
The steepest part of the rapids swings from bank to bank with eddies and even a wave or two if the water is high
enough. After a calm stretch, a dam forces the flow into a culvert, but the dam is very easily portaged on the
right on only wastes about 5' of gradient. A double drop just downstream is fun. The rest of the run has many stretches
of flatwater and the odd shoal. No pool is outrageously long, and with copious water, the current will move throughout.
Upper Swamp could easily be combined with Lower Swamp for a very full day of Central Alabama boating.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The shuttle is painless, just go through Rockford. There is plenty of parking at the take-out, but the put-in is
tight right next to the bridge.

Notes:
From Brad Thompson:[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
Swamp creek, which flows into the terminal end of Hatchett is a fun whitewater run when flowing. You can put in
along HWY 22, just northeast of county road 29. The take out is county road 29 steel bridge, the same as lower
Hatchett. A rock garden when dry but lots of rapids in this short run when it's up.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Lower Swamp Creek @ 1800 falling on the Hatchet gauge:[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
This is a gem of a creek. There are small shoals around most bends in the creek, a lot like the Hatchet for the
first couple of miles. The first rapids require maneuvering around a large tree trunk. 10-15 minutes in, the second
set of rapids may be a fun and fast II. Many easily avoided strainers lay partially across the creek throughout
the run. At the third series of shoals the creek comes very close to a bridge over Hwy 22. A small stream feeds
into the Swamp here, and there are some nice rocks to stop on. Further down, the banks vary from steep and rocky
to sloping. An island splits the creek after a few minutes; the left is scrapy, but the right has a neat series
of waves. In the last mile or so the gradient seems to pick up. There are a couple of fun, continuous II/II+ sets
of rapids with lots of rocks barely submerged and plenty of eddys. Lots of rocks to avoid but great at this level.
After the second of these rapids the gradient disappears and the creek joins the Hatchet at the steel bridge on
CR 29.
