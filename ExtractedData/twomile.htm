TRIP REPORT
Required Level:
400?
Notes:
Two Mile has some fun rapids at good water levels, and a few
logs to avoid or carry around. Like <A HREF="lick.htm">Lick</A> Creek, it is only recommended just after fairly heavy rain when a
short run is desired. I liked Lick Creek better, but Gary and Kevin both liked Two Mile more than Lick. The rapids
are only class II+ or III-, but would not be good to swim since they are somewhat long in spots with enough water.
A few nice front surf and side surf spots can also be found.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

You could put in higher up but there was much barbed wire fence and not a lot of water. The put-in we did use was
on private property, so we got permission from the owner.
