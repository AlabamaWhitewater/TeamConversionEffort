Notes:
If Hwy 67 to 278 is the upper upper, and CR10 to old Hwy 31 is
the upper, what is this long stretch between them from Hwy 278 to CR10? The upper 1.5? I don't know, but I've been
really lazy about listing it in the guide. It has some rapids, and some long flat parts as well. Except for a couple
short bits at high water following feed creek runs, I've never paddled this part of the Mulberry. Most people that
I know that have run it have done the first 6 miles or so from 278 to CR51. Intermediate access points include
CR55, CR51, and CR747/47.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Ben Styles offers the following: This past Monday my wife and I took our 14 ft. tandem open canoe on the &quot;Upper,
upper&quot; run (the level was 6.25'). We decided that we had time to go past 278, so we went down to County Rd.
55. We didn't know whether to expect - boring flatwater or a continuation of the consistent shoals/rapids of the
&quot;upper, upper.&quot; We were pleasantly surprised to discover that with the exception of a couple of 5-minute
paddles, it was a good run. There were approximately 20 shoals/rapids, with 3-4 being strong class twos with high
waves (we had to dump the canoe out twice) at this water level. Today (Friday), we went from County 55 to County
51. While the level was much lower (4.8'), we still had a good run with little flatwater and few rocks. A couple
of rapids would have swamped us for sure at Monday's level.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

While the &quot;Upper, Upper&quot; is still our favorite, at least the first 6 miles below 278 is nice for intermediate
level canoeists like us for whom the class threes of the Locust are about the max (we survived it).[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

From Ryan Stephens: The run from 278 to 51 is a true whitewater run class I-II and did not have excessive flatwater
at all. The section that starts at 51 and goes to CR10 is all flatwater - the kind of flatwater that is pooled
up and has the consistancy of syrup, except for two nice class II rapids at the &quot;shrine.&quot;
