Notes:
Weoka creek is a short run into the east side of Lake Jordan
north of Montgomery. It is mostly I-II with one rapid which resembles a &quot;smaller&quot; version of Jawbone
on Chattooga Section IV, though I'm not so sure about the Jawbone comparison. Weoka is a smaller, steeper version
of the Coosa near Wetumpka. It has a sand and rock bottom (granite covered by that black stuff). The granite seams
cross the streambed perpendicular to the flow to form ledge type rapids. There is minimal action and several pools
until you reach the old Weoka Mills. Here the creek drops about 15' through a series of 2-4' ledges and an old
dam. This would surely rock at higher water levels (we ran it ridiculously low).[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

There are rapids marked on the topo map upstream of the CR 432 put-in, but not much gradient. Check it out if you
wish. It looks like CR 429 (Buyck Rd) would be the next bridge upstream. Putting in there would add about 4 miles
to the run.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Hatchet is a possible rough level indicator. Recent rain is a key. Your guess is as good as mine as far as what
a good level looks like at the put-in. Some flow would be a good start.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
