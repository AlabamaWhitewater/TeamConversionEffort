TRIP REPORT
Required Level:
500 (semi-guess)
Notes:
Capsey Creek, located in the eastern portion of the Bankhead
National Forest, is just north of the metropolis of Addison, Alabama. Capsey is unique and beautiful creek which
drains the forested slopes of this remote region. By Bankhead National Forest standards, this run is relatively
short; you can make the entire run in two hours or less. The stream is carved into a narrow canyon and it has several
smaller tributaries which join the flow in the course of the brief trip. The creek has many sharp turns which could
harbor unwelcome downed timber around a blind curve. There is one beautiful waterfall on river left which cascades
to river level just before joining the creek's flow. Just as you're really getting into the beauty of the trip,
Capsey's flow joins the much larger <A HREF="brushy.htm">Brushy
Creek</A> and the work begins; you must paddle
upstream on Brushy for about a hundred yards to get to the take-out point on Hickory Grove Road. If you're not
into upstream creek paddling, you can take out on land on river right at the confluence and drag your boat uphill
(through the woods) to the road. Thanks, but no thanks, I'll take the upstream paddle![PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

If you're accompanied by non-paddlers on this trip, there is a fantastic hike located upstream of the put-in bridge.
Follow the abandoned logging road on river left and you will be treated to majestic hemlocks, sheer rock bluffs
and some beautiful creek scenery.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
