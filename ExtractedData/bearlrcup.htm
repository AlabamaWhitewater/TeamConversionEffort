Upper Bear has been about as elusive as
any run has been for me. I had my eyes on it for at least 7 years before I finally got over there at a runnable
level. It is a premium micro-creek for the Class IV boater, and will even provide amusement for the expert due
to several clean slides along its upper stretch. Every run you do has something unique about it, and for me Upper
Bear's thing was Holly Bush berries. All over the place. If the run ever re-clogs with wood, these and the briars
will not be your friend.The run begins among several back yards.
It is not wide. Don't judge the flow by the takeout. At the put-in, it's just the largest tributary. The slides
begin immediately. The first one is pretty easy and may be bony. After a few other small slides, you come to a
5' drop followed by a two part slide with a cable across the pool. It's a hoot but watch for the cable. It helps
to have a someone hold it up for you. After a while, you'll see a nice bridge over the creek. Under this is a fairly
narrow and clean slide that'll provide some sluice action. You pick up small tribs in here. Further on you'll come
to a clear cut on your right that ends at the biggest slide. The water slings from one bank to the other until
it pours over. We entered left to avoid the bank on the right at the bottom. After this slide, the character abruptly
changes to a few boulder garden rapids. One class IV will stand out and is easily scouted or walked if desired.Numerous tributaries increase the flow on
the bottom part of the run. The action slows around the Suicide shuttle bridge. You can take out here, but its
only 15 minutes or less to the 176 bridge. If you have the energy, combining this with the run down to the canyon
would be a full day.As of late 2008, there are about 6-8 logs
to contend with, but they can all be limbo'ed or otherwise avoided at low water. None of them are in bad spots
and the creek seems to have been cut out by some good Samaritan.Check out the Hilarious Trip Report from
a high water day in early 2010.----------------------------Originally submitted by Laura Brinkley with
help from Bill Thornton around 2001:[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

This is a surprisingly good run but is only worth doing if it is totally flooded everywhere else. It is hard enough
to catch the normal Bear Creek run, let alone the upper part. At the put-in the creek is maybe 10-15' feet wide
and it stays that way for a lot of the run. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The first real rapid we come up on looked schweet. We were all ready to run it. When you get down to the bottom
drop, the lovely land owners have run a cable across it. Another grunt portage. Apparently, this also is unposted
private property. We portaged on river right with a land owner screaming at us across the river. This was the smallest
of the three slides. This can certainly be run.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The next rapid was a huge slide. Probably 100-150' long and shallow. Enter in the center and ride it. The river
left wall looked undercut. Huge fast slide, it was schweeet. About half way down it breaks right. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
The next big slide was steeper and perhaps runnable (it is), it was also probably in the range of 100-150'. It
is more of a sliding lead-in to a 30' steep falls. We had already started carrying boats around it and no one was
interested in carrying back to run it. Towards the bottom it looked like the wall on river right was undercut.
There is a very nice half mile class 4 gorge below the last falls. For anyone who needs to hike out there is a
dirt road at the last slide which eventually ends up around 35. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Upper Bear currently harbors more portages around strainers than I can count. Portages are through thick gear gouging
briars and holly. My hands are still cut up, I couldn't imagine what it would be like in the summer with everything
grown up. At some times I was throwing my boat ahead of me to mash down the briars. The creek being so narrow there
are places where it is just wide enough to get through because the bushes were growing out from the banks. Eddies
were in these bushes which means hold on to that branch or root. If you have the patience for all the portages
(make sure you wear pants) 11&quot; is a good level. Everything else was flooded and we didn't have many options.
I talked to the land owners a good bit at the third slide, very nice people. They had owned that land for over
15 years and had never seen a kayaker on it, I am guessing that it is not run often. No one in our group had been
on it before.Shorter shuttles exist but they are complex
and I don't know the road names.
