[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
Kirby starts off with a multi-part slide formed at least in part by broken down old millworks on sloping ledges.
Two 10' slides are punctuated by potential pinning rocks on their bottom right. The run continues with generally
slide type rapids of a drop/pool nature. Rapids never get over class III but are surprisingly big for a creek this
small. Both creeks exhibit rather non-boulder obstructed rapids, most likely due to the fact that they are on top
of the Sand Mountain plateau and as such do not have cliff walls beside them from which to deposit rocks in the
streambed. Once <A HREF="stringer.htm">Stringer</A> joins Kirby, the rapids continue until S. Sauty is reached. Kirby
is remotely similar to <A HREF="shortup.htm">upper
Short</A> because the water constricts down to
form a rather turbulent stretch at a place or two. Brief but enjoyable spells of eddy hopping are encountered.
Playspots are available and to top it all off you can run the 8' put-in drop on S. Sauty. Only a few logs were
encoutered in early 1998.
