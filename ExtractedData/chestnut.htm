Notes:
Chestnut Creek begins in the Clanton area and flows south to
Lake Jordan. When the creek reaches the US-31 bridge in Verbena the gradient begins to increase as it drops into
the Coosa Valley area of upper Lake Jordan. I did not see a gage on this bridge but if the first rapid looks good
then the rest of the run will be nice. The river starts off with a nice series of waves and holes in the Class
II variety. The action is pretty good for the next 1/4 mile. The creek then levels out for a short distance When
you see a newer brick house on the right prepare for the next series of drops. These will be some of the best on
the creek. Look for a nice 360 hole on the way down. The rest of the run is intermittent moving flat water and
class I-II waves. It has a few nice long wave train sections. When you get to a large clear cut area look for a
tributary on the right. This will be the first significant tributary and it is called Mountain Creek. Take out
just upstream of Mountain Creek and walk 100 yards to the ford. There may be some rapids downstream but probably
not worth a long paddle across Lake Jordan! [possibly only 0.5 to 0.75 miles -editor][PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The total run is approximately 5 miles. I ran it solo in about 2 hours. Some small play. All the flat water moves
pretty quick. It has a small watershed. I think the time window is about 2 days. We had about 1&quot; of rain last
night and that was plenty. It could be run a good bit lower but I would not want to. It would be a good beginner
run. Good eddy lines, waves, a few holes but not intimidating. I would run it in stealth mode as the local property
owners are as proud of their land as they are their fighting roosters. Plenty of posted signs.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

To find the take out follow US 31 south from Verbena. After approx. 2 miles turn left on county road 23. Follow
county 23 and take the first paved road on the left (You will see a sign for New Harmony Church). Take the first
dirt road on the immediate left. Follow the dirt road to the ford staying right. [you can see this pretty well
on the 1:24,000 topo]. Park near the ford. Chestnut Creek meets Mountain Creek (the creek you ford) about 150 yards
downstream. You can paddle/walk up Mountain Creek to your vehicle. - Bill Patterson[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Brad Thompson has an update to the directions: Mountain Creek take out is off of HWY 31 South at Chilton County
Road 524. You travel this road to an intersection where you turn left and proceed to ford. The Mountain Creek ford
is a good take out.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[The stream continues on after Mountain Creek for another 4.5 miles and has a little more gradient and water over
that stretch. You would have to take out on Lake Jordan by either paddling across the river to possible rural road
access, or 2.6 miles upriver to route 22. It is significant to note that the lake pool comes up about 1.5 miles
up the creek, so the flatwater paddle would not be short. I don't know if either of these are sane options, but
we do lake take-outs up north, so who knows?]
