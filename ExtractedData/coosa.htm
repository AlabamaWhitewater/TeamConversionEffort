Notes:
Site of the annual rodeo at Moccasin Gap. Whitewater with Spanish Moss in the trees. Dam controlled. This is a 'play only' type run. Large portions
of flatwater exist no matter what the level. If you live in, or happen to be in the area, you will be amused. Normally,
it will run at 4,000, 6,000, or 8,000 cfs. I had the misfortune of trying to run it at 2,000 during a dry summer.
It was still better than nothing, but a tame float with very mild play for the most part. Put in either at the
Coosa Paddling Club proporty off CR213, or the dam. Take out at the CPC property off River Rd. just north of Hwy
170.
