The Deerfoot section of the Cahaba River is a fairly nice float
through what is essentially the headwaters of Alabama's longest remaining free-flowing river. The Deerfoot Parkway
bridge is the last public access point on the Cahaba, or the first, depending on which way you are facing. This
section is mostly flatwater, easy shoals and slides, and class II limbo moves around and under trees, but does
contain a really short &quot;gorge&quot; section with big boulders and easy class III drops. This section is just
above the takeout, or about 1.5 miles into the run. The action doesn't last very long, however, and for this reason
I recommend it only as an after-work &quot;nature fix&quot;, or for when we experience centralized rain in the
Birmingham area. It's close to town, you can run it in 40 minutes, and you get to see some crazy Bighorn Sheep
in someones back yard along the way.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
Put in is at the Deerfoot Parkway bridge off I-59 in Trussville, the takeout is the bridge on Happy Hollow road
in Trussville, not far from the Middle School. Minimum for this run is about 150 cfs on the Cahaba@Trussville gauge,
but as always, more is better. The Cahaba is teeny-tiny up here, and the water runs off quickly. Best to catch
it just after a good rain.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
