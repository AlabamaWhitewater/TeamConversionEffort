  A river section is going to be a
  bit obscure when it’s a fork of a fork. What happened to branches? Alf has
  been snooping around the upper reaches of Lookout Mountain with mixed
  results. But this is the prize run of the lot so far. This run is not a
  classic by any means but if the water is fairly high and you want tight
  without too much risk, it may be worth checking out. The first 3/4 of a mile
  is almost flat and has a tree or two. You then arrive at a fun eddy hop or
  sluice which is no problem at any level. It then mellows again before you hit
  Long Branch, which comes in right in the middle of the biggest drops. Eddies
  are small but available. At the bottom of the longest sequence a difficult to
  reach boof is just around a tight turn. Immediately
  after that the creek drops between and over some big boulders. The 6' drop on
  river right was a no go for us due to a bad hole and log combo. With decent
  water an easy line should open up on the left. The II and easy III is intermittent but fun down to the confluence with the
  West Fork proper. Then you have one or two mellow drops with a lot of flatwater and three dams. Each dam could be very
  dangerous and should at least be scouted. 
  
  There are pleasantly few logs
  considering the stream width and how bad some nearby runs are. There are a
  few to go over and walk, and several to limbo under. The shuttle is short and
  easy. The gradient is not easy to figure out since the USGS maps are in
  meters. It takes less water to run this than you might imagine. We ran it at
  low but acceptable water just after the west fork gauge peaked at 360 cfs.
