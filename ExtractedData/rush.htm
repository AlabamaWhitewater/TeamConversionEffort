TRIP REPORT
Required Level:
1000+(4'+ bridge)
Notes:
Rush Creek is a short run that has reasonably continuous class
I at times and maybe a few II's towards the end. It flows into Brushy Creek and shares the Brushy Creek take-out.
It has a lot of whitewater for the Sipsey area, but that is not saying much compared to other areas to the east.
The Scenery is excellent however, and the run can be done quickly if so desired. A few logs cross the stream as
of late 2001, but not so many as to cause undue despair.
