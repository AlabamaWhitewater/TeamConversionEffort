  From
  Jordan Sherman: 
  
  For
  hair-boating enthusiasts, Long Creek is worth exploring when Miller, Coon,
  Jones and the Bear are at high levels. 
  As another tributary of Miller, it contains four of the biggest rapids
  I’ve seen in the state of Alabama…the last one being a mandatory
  portage.  Fortunately, the confluence
  is below all of the action on Miller (which will be blown-out when this
  runs).  All of the scouts/portages are
  straight-forward, and the paddle out is very easy due to several tributaries
  coming in after the Miller confluence.
  
  At
  the put-in you can hike down and scout the put-in rapid.  If it looks a bit low, but manageable, then
  the level will be a good medium flow down in the gorge.  Past the put-in rapid, you’ll see a tight
  slot drop on the right, called, “Your Test Results are Positive”.  After that, look for a fun 10’ ledge.  We ran it on the left several different
  ways and call it “HNIC” (ask Tyler for the disambiguation).  There are several smaller streams coming in
  that increase the flow through some more boogey water before you’ll find the
  Big 3 on Long Creek.  Be sure to get
  out and scout these as they are stacked on top of each other and come-up
  quick (I nearly committed to running it blind).  Think a prehistoric version of “Hair of the
  Dog” on Jones Creek with severe consequences for being off line.  These drops are big, scary and
  runnable.  No need to explain the lines
  on this guide page.  Just watch out for
  the sieve in the middle of the river before the third drop of the
  series.  70 percent of the flow flushes
  through a cave before ejecting 15’ below the drop.  You’ll say one word: “Wow.”  We did!
  
  After
  some more class III-IV boogey, watch for a big horizon when the river is
  about to bend right.  The earth is
  about to open-up.  This is the
  mandatory portage.  It is an impressive
  spectacle of which you’ll want to take pictures.  I cannot even begin to describe it.  It’s a must see!  After the portage, there is a bit more
  run-out boogey until you hit Miller Creek. 
  Now is a good time to utilize the GPS you brought along to find your
  car.

  Video was recorded, but it was
  lost cargo on Coon Creek not long after this trip.
