Super sweet creeky III/III+ with a touch of IV. Only runs
occasionally. It makes a big difference whether the Town gage is rising or falling. South Sauty must
generally be over 2' on the new gage. Check at the Blackoak put-in bridge gage. 0' is really too low,
2&quot; is much better, 1' is meaty, 6-8&quot;or so is ideal. 3' is dangerous but doable by some. We verified
that 15&quot; is exciting but runnable. The problem with 15&quot; is a some of the technical character is gone
and you end up with lots of hole dodging.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The first mile or so is fairly uneventful. Once a rapid with a boof left appears, the action begins. Only two rapids
are definitely class IV, but there is a lot of III+. With the number of strong III's it warrants an easy IV rating
at moderate levels. At high levels (&gt;1.5'?), it is a definite IV with some push.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

A particularly fun rapid can be called 'the bed'. The bed begins with some big pillows, eddies through the mattress,
then you fall off the 5' high endboard. A slide about halfway down often has good surfing. The good rapids come
in two parts separated by a flatter section.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The second part has several fun rapids, and two of particular note. One is a triple slot: The left slot is now
finally do-able with a slide to the right edge since the tree that partially blocked it for years shifted in the
big flood of spring '03. The hardest rapid is towards the end and involves going right to left to avoid a hole
and catch a leaky eddy on the left. Watch out if you catch the eddy low, a slot may suck you in. At high water,
the hole can take you down and put you through the slot whether you like it or not. It has a semi-distinct horizon
line with a narrow line against a rock on the right and a hole upstream of an eddy on the left. A scout is often
in order here.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

As of summer 2003, there is a lot of wood in Blackoak. None of it requires a walk at 2&quot;, but higher levels
may require some portages. Most dangerous in the second drop of the bed, to the left of the pillows. There are
two bad logs here. Alternate routes exist to the right but a scout may be required.
