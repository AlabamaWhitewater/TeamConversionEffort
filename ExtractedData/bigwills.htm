Notes:
There are several sections of Big Wills creek that can be run.
Here are two descriptions starting with an upper run. Lebanon is on the topos but does not make it into the Gazeteer.
It is just east of Horton. There are a couple old mill sites along the way (all upstream of Lebanon?) which might
provide the drops. Many available access roads are available. <A HREF="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=16&n=3809736&e=613014&s=50&size=m"

Big Wills Creek (just west of Fort Payne, in Big Wills Valley) ran adjacent to my family's farm in Lebanon, AL.
My brother and I (and a couple of friends) took Grummans down it, in 1972(?). I do remember it being a lot of fun
at the time (the only paddling we had done prior to that was on flat water). [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Our <A HREF="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=16&n=3811986&e=614761&s=25" target="Frame3">put-in</A>
was on Airport Road in Fort Payne, near the intersection of I-59 and Hwy35. Our <A HREF="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=16&n=3802126&e=608228&s=25"
target="Frame3">take-out</A> was on CR293, near Lebanon.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

We didn't take any pictures. I can't say I remember exactly what the rapids were like, but they were probably class
I/II, interspersed between stretches of flat water. It's a pretty big creek, there were islands, lots of wildlife,
etc. The biggest rapid I remember was a stepped rapid (which flipped one of the canoes). There was at least one
low dam, near Lebanon. I have no idea what the creek is like farther north or south.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

I have paddled Big Wills from Stephens Gap Rd. (pg.26, D4) to Lake Gadsden. The stream flows through a valley with
farmland on river right, and Big Ridge on river left. The water quality would be a 2 at best, because of pasture
run-off during rain, but is surprisingly clear during dry times. The bottom ranges from rocky, to gravel, to mud.
There are many bluffs coming into the creek. Wildlife is abundant, I have seen deer, turkey, raccoon, beaver, nutria,
waterfowl, and even a river otter, which tried to jump into my boat. The fishing is good for bass, panfish, and
catfish. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The creek has many sharp turns, and fast current with decent levels, class I and II shoals abound. There are strainers
everywhere, but there is almost always a clear route. There are several areas in this section of interest, or concern,
for paddlers. Just below Hwy 211 (pg.26, E3) there are several low rock ledges that have standing waves, suitable
for surfing at moderate levels. Just below Hwy 431 (pg.26, F2) there is a 4ft dam that is broken on the far left.
This break is runnable, and may be class II+ or III- with large standing waves. Be careful here, during high water
a portage is very hard, if not impossible. Everywhere other than the break, the water drops vertically 4', creating
an ugly hydraulic. During low water you can portage directly over the dam. The other area of concern is another
dam. This was the pumping station for the now defunct Gulf States Steel. It is directly below the first bridge,
after you cross under I-59. This is a must portage, take out above the bridge and put back in below the dam. The
creek is floatable year round,with only minimal scraping during dry times.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The creek flows through lots of history. It is written that Sequoyah composed part of the Cherokee alphabet in
Duck Springs. The first hydroelectric power plant in the world was built on Big Wills. Alabama Power was founded
there. The marker stands on Hwy 431 where it crosses the creek. The Kyuka bottled water company is located on its
banks. The water comes from a subterranean river, not the creek.:-)
