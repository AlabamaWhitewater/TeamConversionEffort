Notes:
Easy but beautiful, the Upper Blackburn Fork drains the steep
slopes of Pine Mountain near Springville. Bluffs, a few caves, and the occasional lively shoal/rapid. Though not
as difficult as some other runs that might be going off at the same time, it's incredibly nice.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Put in: Dumas Bridge road. Put-in is 20 yards past the iron bridge.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Take-out: Inland Lake. When Blackburn drops into Inland, paddle pretty much in a straight line towards the fishing
center. There is parking, and a bait shop, if you are so inclined.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

**Levels: If the <A HREF="blackburn.htm">Lower
Blackburn</A> is running, which is only a few times
a year, this is probably good to go. Once Highland Lake is full, it seems to run quite well for a few days after
heavy rain. [you might be surprised how long this will run once the lake is full][PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

I have used the Benedict's put in on River Rd., and my family actually owns the land with the little cabin across
from that put in, but there aren't really any rapids until Dumas Bridge, and as of last year, there was a mangle
of trees I had to portage in that stretch. But that put in would make it more worthwhile, distance-wise. -Shane
