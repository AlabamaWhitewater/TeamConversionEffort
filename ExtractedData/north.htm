Located north of Tuscaloosa, North River is definitely worth
listing for scenery and for open boating through about June. Kayaking levels are good in the spring after a heavy
rain. Put in on county road 63. From Tuscaloosa, take Hwy 43 to New Lexington Turn onto county road 55 then left
on county road 63. Take out on county road 38 (Moores Bridge). From the put in, follow county road 63 south (Old
Jasper Road) to county road 38. Turn left on 38 at Samantha and follow to Moores Bridge. The river is class I/II
at normal levels, small shoals and flat water for about the last 3/4 mile to Moores Bridge. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
