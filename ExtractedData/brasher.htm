Notes:
Brasher is brief (it took us 17 minutes at flood) and can be
brisk, brusque, maybe even a brutal swim if it is high. This creek starts out flat and you'll either boof over
or have to walk around several trees as it meanders through the woods. At high water, once the rapids begin, its
nearly one long one to the lake. An S-turn is basically the lead in, then its a curve to the right and you're done.
There are no really distinct or big drops. The shuttle is very short so the whole affair won't set you back much
time. At high water, major hole dodging may be required and hope that there are no trees in critical places. You
can actually see a lot of the steep part by walking up a few hundred yards from the takeout.  A nice play wave
is right above the lake if it is running fat. The pictures show some very high water. Brasher has a small but non-zero
watershed area, so it'll run for a short while after a big rain.
