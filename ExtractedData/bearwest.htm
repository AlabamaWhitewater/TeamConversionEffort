Bear Creek is fed by dam releases from the Upper Bear Creek Dam,
making it the only reliable summer whitewater in northern Alabama. Since it is low gradient drop/pool, it is definitely
suitable for beginners. This would be a good place to start if you have no moving water experience and want a taste
of whitewater in a scenic setting.
Several sections can be run. Access is possible as high up as CR 5. You can take out as far down as Scott Bridge
on Rt. 187. There is a good map at the Dismals
Link above, check it out before you decide which part to run. This site also has a good description of the run,
though their definition of class II may be a bit 'conservative'. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The section from CR 5 to Mill Creek access features Old Mill Falls, which is a runnable class III or III+ drop
depending on your chosen line. The most popular trip is from Mill Creek to Rock Quarry. It starts off slow, picks
up a bit, then is slow at the end. At about mile 2.5 is a nice class II slide with a wave at the top and bottom.
A few hundred yards downstream is the well marked Factory Falls. Factory Falls would be a nice challenging IV if
it wasn't for the pinning rock right in the middle of the drop. It is a must walk. The washout is amusing III.
The whole run would perk up if TVA released 300 cfs or more, but the lake is small and the summers have been dry.
The fishing is not bad.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Below Rock Quarry there is only a bit of current here and there until you reach Hwy 43. Then there is intermittent
class I, with even a mellow wave or two. It is a nice scenic float down to Military Bridge that does not have much
man made encroachment. See also trip report linked above. The entire trip from CR 5 to Military bridge has been
done in 7.5 hrs by some friends of mine, but they paddled fairly hard during the last section.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Commercial outfitters are available. See Link above. Bear Creek Canoe Run outfitter (800) 788-7070, on US43 between
Russelville and Hamilton at the creek is the most popular. For further info, contact Bear Creek Development office
at (877) FOR-BCDA or http://www.getaway.net/bcda[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Bear Creek will also run when the lake is spilling.  Keep in mind that the normal portage route over the rocks
at Factory Falls may go underwater at about 700cfs.  This should not present a problem for someone with whitewater
experience or if you are used to getting out in a shore eddy or similar, but if you are looking for a casual float
it could get dangerous. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
