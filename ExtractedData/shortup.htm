TRIP REPORT
Required Level:
400
1000
Notes:
Three class III rapids mixed in with lots of flatwater and a
bit of II. A good introductory run to easy creeks, used in the past as a qualifier for Town Creek. A semi-grunt
of a take out at the Falls bridge. The usual put-in for Short is the CR 409 bridge at mile 1.4.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

And now, here is a &quot;classic&quot; HCC run description by Ron Paulus, Hal Scofield, Clay Spencer, and John
Watts. We owe a debt of gratitude to the folks who were doing stuff we now take for granted long before a lot of
us knew what whitewater was.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Short Creek is located in Marshall County and is covered by the Albertville topo. The run described here is from
the Alabama 75 bridge, 2.7 miles east of Albertville, downstream 4.5 river miles to Short Creek Falls. This report
was written from a run made 2/15/82 by Paulus, Scofield, Spencer and Watts. No known river guide covers this run.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
To reach Short Creek Falls, take Alabama 227 northeast from Guntersville. After crossing an arm of Guntersville
Lake and a railroad, go 1.9 miles and turn right on County 441. Go 4.0 miles to the bridge, turning left at two
Y's. You may not notice either Y, just stay on the main road. To reach the put-in, proceed on 441 for 3.6 miles
to Alabama 75, turn right, and go 1.1 miles to the bridge.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
The overall gradient is 23 feet per mile, and the maximum is 38. There are three solid Class III rapids, all located
in the last two miles of the run. Other rapids are Class I or straightforward Class II. The run is suitable for
intermediates in either decked or open boats.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[editor: the gage is now on the older Rt 75 bridge] There is no streamgauge; however, water level about an inch
below the top of the concrete pad supporting the bridge piling on the northeast side of Alabama 75 bridge indicates
runnable flow. At this level on a warm day the last two miles of the run rate 17 points, Class III. The second
Class III rapid rates 20 points.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
The first half mile or so has only a few riffles, then Class II rapids appear. They are simple and short, generally
consisting of chutes through a single line of rocks. None has a big drop or large waves. There are holes to play
and good eddy turn practice. After an intermediate bridge [the usual put-in for lower Short these days], the relatively
flat gradient continues for perhaps a mile.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
The gradient then increases to 38; however, the river does not change appearance except at the Class III rapids.
There the drop is sufficient to cause the increased gradient. The first two of these rapids remind one of Town
Creek Canyon. They are long and require Class III maneuvering. The last rapid on the run is short but has a drop
of 4 or 5 feet. The entire river goes through a chute and over a big rock at the bottom of it. The rock has a strong
pillow which tends to push you off of it. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
The difficult takeout is on the right [currently posted and clearcut, take-out river left and park way up the road
towards Guntersville on the south side]. There is no parking space at the County 441 bridge so you can carry your
boat all the way out of the canyon or risk your life by parking and loading in the road. Parking space for a few
cars is available along the road completely up and out of the canyon by the &quot;no parking beyond here&quot;
signs.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
Warning: Short Creek Falls, a 20 foot dead drop, is 700 feet downstream of the takeout. River gradient below Short
Creek Falls reaches 180 feet per mile. [Well, maybe 100'/mile, and generally regarded as an easy 18' waterfall
followed by III+ or IV- depending on level and attitude]
