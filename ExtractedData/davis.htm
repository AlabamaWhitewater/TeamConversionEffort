Davis Creek is a local creek for Tuscaloosa boaters and is also quite close to west Birmingham. It is generally
runnable after rain in winter and early spring. It is mainly too low and lots of snakes in the summer. Width, water
levels and drainage are similar to Hurricane Creek in Tuscaloosa. The guage is hand painted on the old, no longer
used, Hannah Creek Rd bridge. It faces downstream on two river right supports. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Each creek is unique in it's own way. Davis' claim to fame is coal mines. It resides smack in the middle of a major
coal mine zone. The countryside has been stripped, and it is a bit desolate in some areas. The creek is surprisingly
clear though, the strip mining ended some decades ago. Now the mines are subsurface. The coal seams are heavy with
methane, so air pumps dot the landscape. These produce noise and sulfur gas, which is a bit stinky.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The first two runs are low gradient class I. the scenery is nice but section two has a lot of abandoned tires.
Section 2 features constant aggrevating sound from the large mine ventilator fans. This made Tom never want to
run it again.

Section 3 has nice class II/II+ that may edge to III- at high water. The first 7 miles or so have good intermittenet
to continuous action. After you run a four or five foot drop at a former mill, it is pretty flat. The mill is a
good place to stop, eat and rest for the flat but moving water paddle out.

Section 4 has been run but we don't have firsthand knowledge of it. There are supposedly some good spots. John
Wathen named one rapid Agitator since he had some sort of washing machine experience there. Wathen has a very dependable
roll, and nearly swam at the spot. We also don't know where to take out on the lake flatwater. The lake also makes
it hard to figure out exactly how long the run is.
