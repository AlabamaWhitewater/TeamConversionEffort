Notes:
from Brian McAnnally:[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Brewer is another micro creek (that's all that's left), but bigger than you would think from the topo maps.  It
is similar to but longer than Big Scirum without the bigger drops.  Not many real distinct rapids on this one although
there is a nice little slide series near the top.  As of March 2009 it has several badly placed logs.  This is
a fun little run for a class III boater but needs to be cut out.   If it were cleaned out it would be a nice little
class III creek that would be running when Big Scirum goes, with the wood it is IV.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The visual gage on this one would be the pipe culvert where it flows under the road like Big Scirum.  The water
on my run was just below the river right corner where it starts to angle.  A bankfull at the get in would be ideal.
