Notes:
How can it be a class 4 run with no class 4 rapids? There
must be some in there somewhere. Only runnable a few times a year and will drop out in a day except after
really big rains. This is a superb run if you like not too threatening class IV low volume creeks.
Pool drop for the most part. Watch out for a hole about halfway in. (It has been marked in the past by a
small rock cairn). It is guarded on both sides by rocks, so if you get stuck, you may have trouble getting out.
If you have never run it, all rapids can be boat or bank scouted with relative ease. One of the trickier rapids
is towards the bottom. It features two small offset diagonal curler holes just above a 6' drop. Take out at the
Chairlift (grunt) or paddle to the canyon mouth park.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

On 1/26/04, there were 3 logs of note. The first is just below the first rapid as you come aroudn a big rock. It
is just at the surface at about 2-3&quot;. The other two are bot easy to spot. The first of these is a walk while
the second can be avoided by going far left.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

A gage is now on the put-in bridge. 0' is minimum. 2-4&quot; is a nice low-med level. 8&quot; is pushy and big.
If in doubt, the level can also determined by looking at the first rapid just downstream of the put-in. If
it is runnable, so is the run. This thing can be intense if it is high.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

This run can get too high, though it takes lots of rain. Here are some comments from Jed Dugger:[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
8&quot; on the gauge and the canyon was running at about 10,000 cfs, or 9.5' at canyon mouth park. What a great
run at this level. Very pushy, but the rocks are covered and lines are much cleaner. Now when you get to the canyon,
running the lower 6 miles is quick with only one rapid. You guessed it, Bottleneck. Huge waves and holes. You can
paddle the sneak on the right, where you normally portage this rapid, or get into the eddy on the left, 75 yds
above the rapid. There is a small, straight ahead rapid on the left leading down into the eddy. Go to the end of
the eddy, peel out into the center flow and follow the tongue down the middle. Monster holes, both left and right.
The tongue goes right down the center. There is a small reversal at the bottom, BAM, you are through into the pool
below. At this level the water at the takeout will be only a foot or two from the road elevation. The trip takes
only about 25 min. Have fun. JED
