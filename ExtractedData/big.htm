Notes:
Big Creek is one of the few whitewater runs in North Alabama
that is west of I-65.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Big Creek from O'Neal to Shanghai is an easy I/II run with one Class III waterfall and lots of small river wide
ledge type drops on the section above Townsend Ford. Below Townsend Ford the creek quickly transforms to moving
water with gravel shoals. The last quarter mile of the lower section is impounded by Wheeler Lake.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
One-half mile downstream and just upstream of a multiple box culvert is one of larger small ledges. The box culvert
itself has good tilt with surfing options at the effluence. The next rapid terminates under an old iron bridge
with a possible hole forming at higher flows on river right under the bridge. Below the bridge, the gradient lets
up momentarily until you pass the only gravel type shoal on the upper section. Next up is continuous tilt interspersed
with small ledges. A clearing with tributary on the right marks the top of one of the more interesting drops.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
Big Drop is up next with scouting recommended on river left. Big Drop has a very obvious horizon line and there
is a picnic shelter on river right a few hundred yards upstream that can provide additional notice that Big Drop
is imminent. Big Drop is wide and can probably be ran just about anywhere with the more interesting/challenging
lines on river left.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
Just below Big Drop is a sweet double drop followed by one pool and then boogie water to Townsend Ford. The rapid
below Townsend Ford is the longest and most technically challenging rapid on the run. There is an undercut near
the bottom of this rapid that could be hazardous to swimmers. This undercut is near or left of center where the
water is moving diagonally from river left towards river right and may not be visible at higher flows. After the
Townsend Ford Rapid, there is at least one front surfing spot and gravel shoals with occasional imbedded timber.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
A practical minimum level would be being able to float across the low water bridge at the put in. It has been run
at zero on the Townsend Ford gauge (downstream headwall river right) with a little too much scraping but no walking.
