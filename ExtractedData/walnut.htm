Notes:
Walnut Creek is a fun little creek that falls into Lake Mitchell
near Clanton. It maintains its scenic narrow streambed throughout the four mile stretch from CR 32 to the lake,
and the pools are for the most part short. This creek has granite rock jumbles, a far cry from the sandstone and
limestone in the north part of the state. This run is uniformly I and II except for three rapids, two of which
are certainly class III's at decent water levels. A friendly local canoeist told us about 'the falls' and 'the
mill falls'. The last and hardest rapid is just past a low water metal bridge (use caution here). There is not
much wood as of early 2008, just two places fairly close to the put in on CR32 where trees have fallen across the
creek. This is a great run if you are looking for II and a dash of III, or just need something to run in this part
of the state.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

You can also extend the run by 3.8 miles by putting in one bridge further up on Mt. Springs Rd. There is less gradient
but it is pretty, class 1+ , and moves along at ~1&quot; above the top of the river left concrete support pads
on the CR32 (good level). It does work your limbo skills as it has several trees across it, some of which require
a carry at this waterlevel. (upper stretch description thanks to JD). Others have described the upper section as
punishment with strainers and little gradient.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Access can be an issue at the bottom of the run. To get to CR264 from the lake, you may have to cross private property
along the lake. Permission should be sought before doing so. A very gracious landowner, David Miller (205-755-0799),
has granted access across his property to some boaters. He lives on river/lake left, second last house on the creek's
slough/lake-backwater, off of takeout road 264. Paddling to the public boat ramp on the lake is not recommended
unless you relish the workout.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

* 4&quot; below the top of the river left concrete support pads on the CR32 put-in bridge is about minimum.
