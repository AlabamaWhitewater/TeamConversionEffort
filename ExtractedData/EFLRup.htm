  [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
  from Alf Van Hoose:
  How did this
  happen? On a sunny day in March 2011 I am approaching the point of no
  return to ride the slide thru Camp Juliet Low on the upper East Fork Little
  River. About 150 yards downstream my friend is waiting at the end of
  this rapid. What is this rapid doing here? There is nothing but
  mellow Class II above Camp Juliet Low and nothing but mellow Class II below
  Camp Juliet Low after a dinky 4 foot spillway at the end of a girl scout
  swimming pool in the river. I mean like where did this twisty slide
  beam itself from to settle here on top of Lookout Mountain?
  
  I suspected that
  something was going down at Camp Juliet Low. My USGS quad showed 2
  contours lines close together here sandwiched between two others not too far
  upstream and not too far downstream. So earlier this winter I drove
  into the camp and politely asked the guy at the entrance house if he would
  mind if I scouted the river there. &quot;You can't run thru the rocks
  there&quot;. It was clear that he did not want me to drive (or walk)
  any further so I left knowing now there was something interesting down
  there. But a 150 yard slide!No way! Who ordered
  that!! 
  
  Take main route down
  the right side of the Town Creek slide. Narrow it
  downbyabout 50%, more than double its length, and replace the
  hole at the end with its baby brother. Add afew twistshere
  and there. Run it thru a girl scout camp on Lookout Mountain.Until
  I learn itslocal name I will callthis thingSlide Winder.
  
  My plan is to keep my
  boat pointed downstream and ride the main flow. Avoid the ZFS (zones of
  funny slide). Unfortunately we are running today at a medium low level
  for this small creek. The West Fork gauge about 10 miles northwest of
  Camp Juliet Low read 500 cfs about the time we
  started. So there are lots of ZFS in this slide. Maybe 150 cfs here today. Probably better at 300 cfs. But maybe not. At some point there will
  be a transition from &quot;thrilling class IV&quot; to what the Bama Boys would call &quot;stout class IV&quot; and what
  I would call &quot;screaming class V&quot;.
  
  I decide to enter
  Slide Windervery slowly. Bad idea! You should ride the main
  flow atroughly the same speed as it is moving.So it
  slingsme over a hump that scrapes me slower then drops me back
  intothe main flow partly sideways. I recover well and feel the
  acceleration peel my boat downslide fast. Nowmy plan is
  working. The main flow at this level stays mostly in the middle untilwhat
  I call the crossover about 2/3 thru this rapid. There it banks off the right
  bank and like ricochetsacross the channel at 45 degrees to bounce off
  rocks onthe left bank.I ride itthru there OK. A
  small wall of water slows me downthen the steep part of this rapid is
  over. Probably about 25 feetdown in about 300 feet of
  slide. The rest isrelatively slow and the baby hydraulic at the
  end is not a problem.
  
  This run starts off
  badly. Better to put inbelow a dirt roadbridge that the
  flood earlier this week has partly destroyed. Far better to put in
  further downstream where another dirt road is next to the river
  leftbank. But those are probably private roads gated
  off.We are in Georgiaupstream from theLittle River
  forest management area. The forest is mostly clear cut on both sides of
  the river in the first mile making it tough to portagelogs blocking the
  current.
  
  Except for Slide
  Winder this run is not very scenic. Themajor flood of September
  2009uprooted numerous treesand bentjust about everything
  growing on many sections of the East Fork riverbank.
  Fortunatelythe river rightbank iseasy to
  walktoportage Slide Winder. Atour levelit was
  safe to stop nearwhere that rapid starts. At higher levels I
  would stopfurther upstream if I were you. There are no eddies in
  Slide Winder. 
  
  Shuttle:FromMentone
  AL drive east on AL 117. Turnright on Dekalb
  CR 635about 1 mile after crossing thebridge over theMiddle
  Fork Little River. Drive south about1/2 mileto
  the bridge over the East ForkLittle River.This takeout
  ismore comfortable than taking out at the GA 48 highway bridge.
  But it is also 1/2 mile further. Drive back toAL 117, turn right,
  driveabout 1 1/2 miles east on AL 117 / GA
  48,then turn left on GA 157 in Cloudland GA. Drive about5
  milesnorth on GA 157 then turn left on Gilbreath
  Hill Rd and drive about 3/4 miles to theGilbreath Creek bridge. There is a old mill spillwayon the
  upstream side of this bridge. Gilbreath Creek
  joins Gamble Branch about 200feet downstream to define the start of the
  East Fork Little River.
