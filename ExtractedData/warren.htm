  Warren has been mentioned in the American
  Whitewater Cole City Creek (GA) description for years. It starts in Alabama
  and ends up in Georgia. It has a tiny watershed so I’d always dismissed it.
  Your eyebrows might arch a bit when you looked at the topos.
  “Punchbowl Gulf, eh?” Hmmm. In the fall of 2010 the nice hiking days were
  upon us so I checked it out. As soon as you walk up to the obvious opening
  drop at the power lines its ‘whoa baby, that’s a big one’. We chopped it out
  a week after our hike. There were a ton of logs removed. 
  
  The opening drop is indeed a
  punchbowl vertical into a big deep pool. The entrance is somewhat twisty. The
  rest of the run is tight IV+ with a one to three V’s. Unfortunately a lot of
  clear cutting is going on just upstream of the Cole City Confluence. There
  are now a big number of trees to get around there. You then paddle out on a
  hopefully flooded Cole City Creek from Georgia into Tennessee.
  
  There are two access options at
  the top. You can either put on from the road and deal with about half a dozen
  logs, or ask permission to put on off AL 259 on Tom Vann’s land under the
  power lines. Either way, the walk around the waterfall, should you choose not
  to fire it up, is on river left. You will want to make the mover left far
  enough upstream of the falls, so be on your toes. Level can be judged at the
  outflow of the plunge pool from above. If there is just a bit of water
  covering the rocks at the outflow, it should be at a runnable but low level.
  More water will quickly get spicy.
