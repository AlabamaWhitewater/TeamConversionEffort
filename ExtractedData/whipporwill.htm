Notes:
An alternate semi-high water put-in for the <A
HREF="scarhamlow.htm">Lower Scarham</A> run. Very short but with a few easy rapids that make a fairly short run a bit longer. Whippoorwill
empties into <A HREF="shoal.htm">Shoal</A>, which then hits Scarham at Double Bridges.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
I've never run it, and it would take a bunch of rain, and it might be too tight to be worthwhile, but the ~2.1
miles from the next bridge up to the put-in may drop about 80-100'. You can go even higher, but you may already
be too high to be serious. Let me know if you run it.
