TRIP REPORT
Required Level:
Notes:
The put-in for this trip is unlike any of the other Sipsey River
head waters trips because the trip starts in an upland woodland instead of a hemlock-lined canyon. As the
creek flows south, the canyon walls draw closer and the scenery gradually changes into the typical Sipsey bluff-lined
canyons. During periods of heavy runoff the canoeist will think they are in a shower due to the noise of
the many waterfalls which run over the bluff lines. After 3.4 miles, the creek runs beneath a bridge on Bunyan
Hill Road (F.S. Road 224). This bridge serves as an alternate put-in for a 2.5 mile trip on down to the takeout.
Borden Creek joins the <A HREF="thompson.htm">Sipsey
River</A> 2 miles below Bunyan Hill Road.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

In September 2009 at about 400cfs, there were 4 to 6 major strainers before the bridge at Bunyan Hill Rd and one
shoal that we had to carry across. I think 400cfs on the sipsey gauge is minimal for the upper section. After passing
Flannigan and Braziel, the flow and the depth get much better. A quarter mile below Bunyan Hill Rd, there is a
great waterfall and cave to explore on river left. The waterfall is visible from the river and the large boulders
hide the small cave that is part of the walking trail along Borden Creek.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
