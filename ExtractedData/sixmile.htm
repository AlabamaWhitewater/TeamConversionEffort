Watch out for the sinks about half way through the run. Lots
of water flows into a cliff. Northeast of Centreville. East of Tuscaloosa. If you have more info, let me know![PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Sixmile Creek, is a different story. I paddled the creek about eight years ago in a tandem canoe. It was deadfall
city. It was a pretty float but not worth the aggravation the deadfalls caused. Some of these were behind blind
curves and most of the portages were difficult. - Tom Land
