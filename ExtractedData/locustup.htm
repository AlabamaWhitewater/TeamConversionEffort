Not run too often. Lots of flatwater, but has a neat, short
gorge section. Put in around Cold Branch Hollow, if such a thing exists. The gorge has a 5' slide drop followed
by a few smaller drops. In the last 2 miles or so, you encounter junkyard rapid, where you will find a glassy front
surfing wave which only gets better as the water rises. Towards the end, you pass through the Kings Bend racecourse.
Take-out at the normal put-in at 79/231 bridge (gage station on map). Put-in where the road comes close to
the river about 10 miles upstream of the take-out. Requires a bit more water to be fun than the lower sections.
A really fun introductory tandem section.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The put-in above involves lots of flatwater, and is on the south/river left side. Alternate access may exist on
the north/river right side. Consult thy map and good luck.
