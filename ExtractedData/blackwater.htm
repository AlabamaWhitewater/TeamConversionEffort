Located just north of Jasper, Blackwater creek is a scenic 4-mile
trip with Class II rapids and shoals. This makes a great introductory whitewater trip for the beginner and seems
to run more often than many other rivers in the state. This is probably due to higher rain amounts to the west
and a swamp upstream acting as a capacitor for the flow. Blackwater will go up to a level after a rain and then
hold there for a day or two rather than falling off sharply.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

At 500 cfs, there is a great surfing wave adjacent to a Boy Scout campground which is complete with picnic tables
and shelter (a great place for lunch). There is one good, long Class II+ rapid with a good surf spot in the final
drop. Ideal level is between 500 and 750 cfs. A 1500 cfs trip will be a quick run with fast water and big waves;
the longest rapid may have big holes at this level. Over 500 cfs, there is a fair bit of play on several spots
along the river.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

If you're looking for a shuttle, the owner of the craft shop adjacent to the take-out bridge will provide this
service for a fee. As a footnote, fishing in the spring is said to be excellent on this creek. (Murray Carroll)
