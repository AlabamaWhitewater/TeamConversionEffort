  Sugar Creek is a spring fed
  watershed which flows out of the Pulaski, TN area and drains into the Elk
  River in Limestone County, AL. The stream is generally runnable all
  year long but sees very little use by canoeists. There is good current
  throughout this section. The narrow stream twists and turns and is a
  very technical stretch due to downed timber. Really good bass and
  redeye fishing (there are TONS of Rock bass). Note: This stream,
  though only rated Class I, is not suitable for unaccompanied beginners due to
  the swift current and numerous strainers. (Murray Carroll)[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

  Another section discussed in the linked trip report is from AL 99 to Cottonbelt Rd. Evidently it is impossible to park at the Cottonbelt Rd. takeout on public property near the creek
  without blocking a road. If you would like to float this stretch, please
  check with Don Mansell, a local landowner, for
  permission to cross his property before you go. Don's email is
  dmansell@HiWAAY.net (or just click <A href="mailto:dmansell@HiWAAY.net">here</A>). In addition to blocking roads and drives, there have
  been litter problems as well. As Don puts it: &quot;It is not that we don't
  like people that enjoy the creek that we moved here to be near, but we have
  had many that leave trash along its banks and on our property.&quot; Not
  littering and being courteous about river access are two examples of how we
  can take simple steps to stay on the good side of local landowners, and
  thereby help to maintain access for future paddlers to the many rivers and
  streams of Alabama.
