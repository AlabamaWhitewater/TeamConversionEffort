Notes:
Just east of Auburn, Sougahatchee is one of the many creeks that
can be run in the area. There's not a lot of gradient, but it beats the heck out of Florida. I'm not exactly sure
which road leads to the steel bridge takeout, BTW.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Quite a few of the runs on the AW page were lifted directly from this site. I don't remember ever doing that in
the other direction, but I am on this run. So with full apologies (if necessary) to Van, here it is:[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

This run provides some nice class II water and some pretty scenery for kayakers or canoeists at lower levels and
a great park-and-play spot at high water. There is a 10 ft slide immediately following the put-in that is very
easy on the left side at lower water, but watch out for some holes at the bottom as the water level increases.
When the creek is very high, above 2000cfs, a really nice hole forms directly below the bridge at the put-in. (See
pics and vid) At 2000 the hole is playable but a little shallow. 2500+ is sweet. 3000+ is great. Running the creek
is not recommended when it is high enough for the hole to be good. Not only is the creek near flood stage and full
of strainers, but the holes at the bottom of the slide are very nasty. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

There's a USGS gage on the bridge at the put-in. It's Sougahatchee Creek at Co Rd 188 near Loachapoka. Minimum
to run the creek is around 500 cfs, but that's scrapy. Minimum for the bridge hole is around 2000-2500. The road
to the steel bridge takeout on Sougahatchee Creek is Lee County Rd. 056. From the put in, it is the third paved
road to the right.
