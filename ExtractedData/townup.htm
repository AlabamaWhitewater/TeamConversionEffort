Notes:
With enough water, this is a fun class I and II run with easy
access. Fortunately, in winter and spring, Town seldom gets too low to run. Put in just below a slide rapid at
the site of an old mill at Hwy 227. The old mill slide is pretty nasty looking though it has been run. It sports
a big sticky looking hole at the bottom. The very next rapid is relatively narrow and tricky, but the rest of the
run is considerably easier. Don't forget to take out above the walking bridge, High Falls is a 50' drop![PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]
There are stop signs at High Falls Park that the new sheriff demands you stop at. He also requested in a beligerant
tone that all who enter should check in at the office. He made mention of the 15 mile an hour speed limit as well.
