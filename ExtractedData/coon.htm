TRIP REPORT
Required Level:
350
Notes:
Flat Rock/Coon is the 600 yard par 5 of Sand Mountain whitewater.
<A HREF="bryantjones.htm">Jones</A> may have harder rapids (?), but it is not as long. There are those
who can make this run with relative ease, but I've proven that I'm not one of them. Yes, inadvertent overnighters
and multi-day expeditions are a possibility here. Can you say epic-friendly? I recommend a guide and a long day,
or a really long day without a guide. If you must walk out, walk south, not north. North takes you through a very
large abandoned strip mine.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Put in at the downstream bridge at the intersection of 117 and 71 on Flat Rock Creek. Flat Rock would be a fun
IV (V) run if only you could take out at where Coon begins. The run starts out easy, with a few class IIIs and
a fair portion of flatwater. The action picks up after awhile and is really a lot of fun for the class IV appreciative
crowd. Then there is at least one solid class V and a couple IV and IV+s before the confluence with Coon. One drop
features a hard to avoid undercut wall on river right. Another just above Coon treated the author and his C-1 to
a most enjoyable pin. The last rapid above Coon has a cool 10-12' slot drop as its climax.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Then Coon begins when a tributary joins after five miles of Flat Rock. The next mile drops 260'. There is no shortage
of class Vs here. If the water is up, you will now know it without a doubt. Some rapids are not short, and the
portages are not easy. This is the part that bogs people down since they are already tired. If you make it past
this stuff, you get to enjoy the 4+ mile lake paddle to the boat ramp.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Coon used to be infinite chicken water quality due to strip mining. In fact the first party to run it is reported
to have thrown their equipment away after their run. But the situation seems much improved since the demise of
the steam shovel on the Alabama landscape. [PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

*This will run with a bit less water than Jones. There is a small dam just upstream of the put-in bridge. If the
water is going over that real well, the run will be too high. An inch or two is getting high. Just a thin film
of water over the dam would be about right. <A HREF="bryantjones.htm">Jones</A> should be around 11&quot;
or so.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

above but do give a graphical feel for how the gradient is distributed.
