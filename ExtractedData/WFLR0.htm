  From Alf Van Hoose:
  Weput inon
  a cold day at about noon. The West Fork gauge downstream had peaked several
  hours earlier at 2000 cfs and wasreading 1700
  cfsSundayat noon.The North
  Branch of the West Fork was runningbank full at a level thatwas
  uncomfortable for this run. The pipes under the bridge were about 1/2
  full and a footbridgeabout 1/4 mile downstream was mostly less than 1/2
  foot above the current.Ifyou try this run at this level (or
  higher!) get nervous!! Branches across the water constantly block your
  vision and the logs areusually stuck infast current or in the
  channels around the few boulders during the first two miles. During the
  fourth (fifth?, sixth?) portagemostly thru a
  jungle of plants on the shore I asked myself&quot;Why are you doing
  this?&quot;. Good question. I will let you know when I have a
  good answer!
  
  About two miles
  downstream shortly after passing a house visibleon river right the
  river drops out of sightbetween boulderson the right
  center. Whoever runs this boulder chokedrapid that drops about 12
  vertical feet in a twisty channel gets to name it. Until then I call it
  Not Today. After all it was
  a cold day, I was tired from portaging strainers, it was my first run this
  year, etc, etc,
  etc. Note that there is a trail on river right that leads to the shore
  below Not Today. This would be avery good put-in for this
  runifit is OK with the landowners there. I am not sure what
  state we were in there. If that rapid were on the state line we could
  name it Welcome to Alabama.
  
  Thenext 1 1/2
  mileswere more enjoyable with only two logs that required a
  portage. Then the 1/2 mile above the confluence with the East Branch of
  the West Fork was fun. Fairly continuous Class III at our level that
  was mostly easy to see from upstream. It is
  not clear whether those rapids should be rated Class II or III at normal
  levels
  
  The East Branch doubled
  the volume of the river. The channel became much wider but the gradient
  became much flatter. It would have been a pleasant float to Taylor Ford
  except for 3 more portages. This time the problem was man made.
  Damn dams! The hydraulic below the first dam was the worst keeper I
  have seen in years. About 1000 cfs smoothly
  poured over a river wide horizon line causing a back suck from 10 to 15 feet
  downstream. The second dam could probably be run far right down a slide
  but we portaged on general principles. I was too tired to scout the
  third dam closely. We carried all dams on river right.
  
  In general this run
  was not very scenic. But perhaps thegray overcast weather was
  partly responsible for my lack of interest in the riverbank scenery.
  Ionly recommend this runfor those whowant to run something
  new and are willing to portagenumerous
  logsmostly stuck in the first two miles. If the North
  Branchwas clear of wood thenI would rate this runclass
  II+withone classIV+ rapid. Butit is risky to
  runthe upper part of the North Branch at any level because the logs are
  bad and the visibility is often very short range like about 20 feet!
  
  Shuttle:FromMentone
  AL drive east on AL 117. Turn
  left (north) on Dekalb CR 631 (Cove Rd) after
  crossing the narrow bridge over the West Fork Drive about 1 1/4 miles then turn left on the
  dirt road (CR 517) that winds about 100 yards to the river left side of
  Taylor Ford. Drive back to Mentonethen turn right at theCR 89
  intersection. Drive about 9 miles northeast along the rim of Lookout
  Mountain then turn right atthe Sulphur
  Springs Gap intersection. Drive about3/4 mile on Sulphur Springs Road to theriver bridge. Note that this roadis named &quot;Sulphur Springs&quot;
  on the west and &quot;Yankee&quot; on the east of that intersection.
