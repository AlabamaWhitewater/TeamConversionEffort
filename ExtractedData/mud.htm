Notes:
At approximately 75-100 CFS, Mud Creek is about 2 &frac12; miles
of fun Class I-II paddling with very few obstructions or bottom scraping along the way. We only had a few logs
that required either a contorted &quot;limbo&quot; to get under or a little speed to get over. The creek's gradient
is fairly constant. There are two or three good Class II rapids and a number of Class I shoals punctuated with
only short sections of moving flat water. Unfortunately, you arrive all too soon at the confluence with the Mulberry
Fork.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

The Mulberry is mostly swift moving flat water punctuated with occasional rapids that consist primarily of large
wave trains. There are a few trees down in the river that have to be paddled around. There are also a few pretty
good waves for surfing along the way.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

To paddle Mud Creek, you need major rains the night before and a level of at least 5000 CFS at the Garden City
gauge on the Mulberry Fork. If the rapid at the put-in on the creek appears to have enough water to run without
scraping, the level is adequate. The put-in is about mid-way between Holly Pond and the Mulberry Fork Bridge on
highway 278. There is no bridge over the creek, it passes under the highway through large pipes. On ecould also
take out at the CR 55 bridge for a 2.5 mile run on the Mulberry - Dave Curry
