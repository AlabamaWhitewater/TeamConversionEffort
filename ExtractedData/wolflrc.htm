TRIP REPORT
Required Level:
Notes:
This Wolf has no really reliable gauge. You need to look at the
creek to check if it is running. Realize the canyon will probably be at a scary level and you will be running Deep
Throat at some screaming high level. Wolf Creek is hard to describe adequately. It is a typical very steep limestone
sandstone creek. Their are several drops that I'd advise portaging. A few are probably not runnable, or at least
not really healthy to run. If you are good enough to make the creek just remember that it flows into the Little
River about a quarter mile below Humpty Dumpty. Takeouts include the Chairlift or the Canyon's mouth. by Will Reeves[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

(I've walked it. Others run it. Steep, tight, and obstructed. Not easy with a couple big waterfalls
right at the top. Note the gradient: 280' in about 1/2 mile. Lookout Mountain endured an ice storm in January 2000
so it could be choked by trees. Mark D')[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Richard Vest, Lenny Rubin, and others probably had the first descent of this run. He commented that LRC was huge
when Wolf had enough water, as expected.[PARAGRAPH_BREAK]

Below is a profile of the creek gradient. These data are not as accurate as the gradient field above but do give
a graphical feel for how the gradient is distributed.
