		A very early rogue sighting at House Rock.  That might be Dave B, Murray, and Rob Welch in the eddy but I'm not sure.  No Helmets required in 1994, evidently.

		Murray Carroll tempting fate by running to the right of the pillow rock at the bottom of the first drop of Double Trouble.  Note his manly lack of helmet.  This is back when the boats were big and the men were men.

		Jeff Bowen says "what the heck" as he rides out the first drop of Double Trouble next to, rather than in, his boat.  December 1993.

		Charlie Stotts in truly rare form way back in 1992 on Powell Falls.  Them are muscles and that is a whoppin' big foam block, ladies and gentlemen.  Not a small boat to be seen back then.
