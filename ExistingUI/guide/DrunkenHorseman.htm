<p class=MsoTitle>The Naming of Drunken Horseman </p>

<p class=MsoTitle>(More Than Just a Paddlesnake)</p>

<p class=MsoTitle><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>By Bill Patterson <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I have
learned that trolls come in all shapes and sizes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Trolls also come from a wide variety of places.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This particular troll emerged from a nasty
undercut in South Sauty creek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Our first encounter with this troll
was in the mid 90’s during our first descent of South Sauty.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Chuck Kirk was taking Jim Kelly, Josh the
Punk Kayaker and myself down the creek on a nice 24 degree afternoon.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a brief respite from the some nice
drops, Jim found a particularly menacing undercut.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>From the top of the drop it looks like you can run down a slope
and boof left in front of the big rock in the center.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Au contrair, trying to pull that move will find you landing on
another semi-sloping drop below the boof rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>You will then slam sideways into the nice undercut rock in the center of
the river.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is exactly what
happened to Jim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I looked down from
the eddy above, all I could see was Jim’s pogies and paddle sticking out from
under the rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After several attempts
Jim managed to extract himself from the rock and roll up in the eddy
below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From the top eddy the whole
event looked terrible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After I ran the
drop and caught up to Jim, we discussed the situation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Laughingly Jim mentioned that it was pretty
horrible under the rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I seem to
recall that he mentioned something about a troll.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Years later in the spring of ’02
Jim and I found ourselves back on the creek with Ross Kramer and Mike
Huff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After meeting up with some more
friends on the creek, our group grew to about eight including a first timer who
was running it with her boyfriend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Since Jim’s incident we had learned to give that nasty rock a wide berth
in order to avoid another encounter with the minion that lurked below.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our repetitive experience with the rapid had
given us a certain amount of contempt so we gave that particular drop very
little consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was running
sweep and told the newbie to watch the undercut in the middle as we began to
enter the last busy section.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I told
her to watch the undercut she did exactly that as she slammed into the
rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I am sure that she saw it from
the side as well as the bottom once she went under.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The whole incident looked absolutely horrible from the top.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a nice battle with the rock and the
troll that lurked beneath, she emerged and was deposited in the eddy below the
rapid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shortly afterwards her boat
followed sans paddle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I quickly ran the drop and ferried
over behind the undercut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I noticed a
fair amount of water flowing out below the rock and quickly deduced that the
paddle was still under the rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That
is where I made my tragic mistake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Another boater and I climbed up on the rock and attempted to dislodge
her paddle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After quite a few attempts
we gave up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Little did we know that the
damage had already occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The troll
had been disturbed one too many times and he also got a look at my face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Not knowing what had actually taken
place, I gave the girl my paddle and took off down the creek using my hand
paddles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After running through the
Minefields, the Slot and Bonecrusher Mike Huff produced a ceremonious flask of
Scotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mike, Jim and I polished off
the flask as we cruised the remaining class III’s.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">   </span>We were comfortably num as we beached our boats at the
takeout.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was time for hot showers,
more refreshments, river stories and hanging out at my party trailer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After a couple of hours the Troll
came looking for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I did not know it
at the time but he was under the guise of a horseman that lived at the top of
the gorge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Troll was quite ornery
and a little drunk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For some reason he
really seemed to have it in for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
Troll was luring other members from our party to ride his horse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Jim went for a quick ride as Brian poured
whiskey down the Troll, hoping that he would quickly tire and go home.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No such luck.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The Troll kept on insisting that I get on the horse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(I later deduced that he was trying to get
me back to the undercut.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The more the
Troll pushed the harder I resisted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>Jim soon returned to allow the Troll to return to his lair.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He did not accept the offer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was when Jim poured him another
triple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After swilling down the last drink
the Troll became quite beligerante.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>That was when Mark D and others arrived to witness the menace.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After one last attempt to lure me back to
the undercut, I jokingly asked the troll if he needed a good ole fashioned
Alabama ass beating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Troll bowed up
and said “let’s go!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At that point in
time I sensed that something was way beyond “not quite right.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I assured the Troll that I was just
kidding as Brian poured him one last one for the road.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We then received our reprieve.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Troll mounted his horse and left for his
lair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The next day I realized how lucky
that I had been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After talking to other
campers, I learned that the Troll had fallen of his horse on several occasions
trying to make it out of the canyon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In
the end the Troll had walked off with his horse into the night and I had
luckily turned in to my bed with visions of undercuts dancing in my head.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The moral to this story: Give the
undercut in Drunken Horseman a wide berth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If the Horseman comes calling at the end of the run then give him at
least ½ a fifth and run the other way!</p>
