font-family:Arial'>I’ve always wanted to hike into The Walls of Jericho.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I never really knew exactly where they were
but I did know that they were on private land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I had heard mention of pretty extreme class V rapids.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the last few years, they had popped up on
my radar screen a few times when someone would ask whether Turkey Creek had
been run through the walls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At least a
couple groups claimed to have made the run but I never had seen pictures.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At long last, after the Nature Conservancy
purchased the property and even told us how to get there at a HCC meeting this
spring, I had to go at least look at it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Curt and I hiked in via the AL 79 route from the east in the
spring of 2004.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was steep, but we
found The Walls, culminating in the amphitheatre and the famous cave where at
normal flows all the water flows over a big waterfall, into a pit, and then
through the rock wall for a few hundred yards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Below this were lots of slides, a fair bit of wood, and nice
scenery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fateful move was our
decision to find out what lay above the amphitheatre.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Many have hiked into the amphitheatre but few have ventured
beyond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a fairly easy free climb
up a small cliff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We were apprehensive
about getting back down but went for it nonetheless.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Above the amphitheatre, we found more excellent scenery and a
series of clean, very fun looking class IV drops.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>I filed the trip in my memory, put it on my to-do list, but
did not take it too seriously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Access
was a major issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I generally refuse
to walk up from the bottom of a run and this one would require several miles of
hiking just to get to the bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
looked like you could get in from Tennessee to the north by hiking on logging
roads, but I never got around to verifying that the road was navigable to the
old cemetery where the trails begin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Fortunately, Curt took the trip seriously.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We were supposed to go to West Virginia, but
as Ivan approached, it seemed silly to travel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>When I asked him in the week leading up to Ivan’s arrival what he wanted
to do, he said, “that teacups run over in the walls of Jericho”.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a day or so I was psyched as well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We met for lunch on Tuesday so he could
borrow my GPS unit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He then drove up
that night to verify that we could get to the Little Mountain Cemetery.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His report was positive, and the game was
on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All we needed was a crew and rain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The rain fell in significant quantities on Thursday.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We assembled a good group or four.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wade Amis and Brian McAnally joined Curt and
I.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Both had climbing experience and are
great exploratory trip members – they almost never get mad.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wade and I had been through the Flat Rock /
Coon experience, and both he and Brian had suffered through Rice Creek.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each of the group members has been a
beneficiary and a victim of several of my wild goose chases in search of new
water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We all felt this first run should
be a decked boat affair, and in retrospect we were correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>We knew we needed a long day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We left Gurley at 7:20am, left vehicles at the semi-flooded
take-out north of Estill Fork on CR9, met Brian, and were hiking in by
9:30am.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We stopped several times along
the way to make sure we did not get off the correct old road.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was mostly flat or downhill.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had covered about 1.5 miles when a steep
uphill section at a small tributary confronted us.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We decided to eschew the uphill and instead drag down the
travertine covered tiny creek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We put
on Turkey Creek about 0.5 miles above Poplar Creek confluence at 11am.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The first mile+ was fairly flat, as expected.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even though the area had just received 5-7
inches of rain, this section was bony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It was pretty, but there were only some II’s and maybe a III.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then it all became worthwhile.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The drops we had seen above the amphitheatre
were, if anything, better than I had expected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They started off with a small ledge, then a boof, and then they got
bigger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A 10’ clean slide, a three part
rapid with the top under a high clearance undercut cliff– this was cool
stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The level here was about
right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe a bit more would have been
better, but for a first run, this was very good.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We could even easily run the rapids to within a short distance of
the mandatory amphitheatre portage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The expedition really kicked in at the amphitheatre.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we were getting ready to lower boats down
past the unrunnable waterfall flowing into the pool where the cave starts, Curt
bumped into Wade’s stuff and knocked his paddle into the water 50’ below.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Did we have a spare paddle?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Hand paddling time had evidently arrived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>We had hoped to run the drops below the mandatory
portage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first rapid was no nig deal,
but it had a sticky looking hole that led directly into a 12’ waterfall, which
landed on rocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This in turn fed into
the really big drop/slide that falls into the amphitheatre.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>, Though it would have made an incredible
picture, it was ~30’ of rock-induced pain waiting to happen<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So we lowered boats down the 12’er, lined
them through the last pool, then rappelled and lowered boats into the
amphitheatre.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This took a while.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We each ran the last part of the slide, and
Brian walked back up and tossed his paddle across the rapid to Wade so he would
not have to hand paddle it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meanwhile,
I had cut out a pesky log that went across the next rapid with my Sven
saw.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wade ran the drop and began to don
the hand paddles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To Wade, the four
mile flat water paddle-out on Hurricane loomed even larger than the remaining
rapids on Turkey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I ran next.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After landing, I glanced downstream and there
was Wade’s paddle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sweet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>I continued my photo slut ways and ran that drop twice, made
Curt go ahead to take my picture, and generally irritated and amused Wade.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The rest of the run was low water slides,
ledges, and rock gardens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The rock
gardens were highly boat abusive at this level.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Curt’s Huck re-cracked for about the fifth time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time we paddled the four miles of
Hurricane in about 90 minutes or so, Curt was either dumping or carrying an
extra 20 gallons of water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A fitting
last run for the Huck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Now that I’ve had time to reflect, this may have been the
most satisfying run I’ve ever done in Alabama.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It had hardship and great reward: hiking, paddling, rappelling,
incredible scenery, the works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We may
have been the first group to run above the amphitheatre.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Amazingly, Bill Thornton and his group were
only an hour or two behind us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even
harder to believe, the hiked out to Hwy 79!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Our run
through The Walls of Jericho was really all you could want in high exertion
paddling adventure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It took a fair bit
of planning and a willingness to take a chance on water, orienteering, fitness,
and the odd outdoor skill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Curt puts
it, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>it is hard to
overemphasize the significance of a good crew in making the day so astounding.
The absence of real complaints regarding the hiking and trail confusion, Wade
not getting mad about Curt bumping his boat and the resulting paddle loss,
Brian's competence with the ropes, etc. allowed the enjoyment of the rapids,
scenery, and adventure to stay firmly in the forefront.</span><span
