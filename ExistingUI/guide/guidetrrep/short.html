<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A Long Day on Short Creek</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">20 February 1999</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">by: Dave Curry</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When we saw the mutilated cow on the creek
bank, I knew we were in for an unusual trip. The aliens had obviously done
a surgical job that had totally terrified the poor beast. The skin had
had been scraped clean of hair, his entrails removed, and the eyeballs
were popped so far out of the skull they looked like tennis balls. When
Dave Branham and I met John Ellis at Hardee’s I was hoping that we would
have at least some vestige of adult supervision for the planned Sand Mountain
excursion; it was not to be. Mark D’ was busy, Gary Holder was unavailable,
and John Parker was nowhere to be found. We were to be left to the guidance
of Dave and our own devices. Dave was eager to paddle Short and I had no
objections. It took a few minutes of persuasion to get John to acquiesce.
We headed for the put-in.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We had only been paddling for a few minutes
before we encountered the mutilated cow. A couple hundred yards downstream,
we had our first anomalous event: John got into a wrestling match with
a tree trunk. Quick thinking and the exercise of a little rescue training
on Dave’s and my part spared him a watery fate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first major obstacle on the creek is
Short Creek Falls: a “straight over” 22 foot [editors note - maybe 18']
waterfall. This being John’s and my first trip on the creek, we decided
to walk it. Dave, the “Master of Waterfalls”, opted to show us the correct
line for our next run. After watching Dave’s run, I have wondered how it
is possible to turn a boat upside down and get out of it, all while falling
22 feet. Dave ended up on the right bank of the creek and his boat on the
left bank. An accurate throw with my rope and a good swim on Dave’s part
got the two back together again. All we had to do was wake John up (he
had fallen asleep on the rocks at the top of the falls) and we were on
our way again.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All three of us had good runs on Grotto
Falls. John and I landed upright at the bottom of the 10-foot drop while
Dave performed a masterful combat roll after his pencil point run. It was
pretty slow going all the way down through the major rapids. We spent quite
a while bank scouting each one as we came to it. I had a couple of mandatory
self rescues while John had the foresight to walk a couple of the nastier
ones. On one of the drops Dave and I both hit a rock really hard with the
back ends of our boats. Unbeknownst to me, it would later prove to be a
real problem.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The last rapid before the confluence with
Scarham Creek is a several hundred yard long constricted eddy-hop with
random boulders and pour-overs. I started down the right hand side. As
a left handed paddler, this created some problems (most of the eddies were
on my right); it seemed that my boat was getting heavier and heavier and
more squirrely with each passing second. When I was almost to the bottom,
I hit a rock and turned over; I quickly rolled back up, but didn’t quite
regain control before I ran over a small pour-over into a hole. I was upside
down in a heartbeat. One roll attempt spun me like a top and left me upside
down again. At this point, I decided to pull the cord and eject. I popped
up in a white foamy world. The water was so aerated, I could barely keep
my head above it. I tried to swim to the eddy. I felt this giant hand pulling
me toward the base of the pour-over. I didn’t quite get there; the current
jerked me straight down and then popped me up about ten feet downstream.
I tried swimming again and got a repeat performance from the hole. I did
manage to see Dave about 25 feet away getting his rope out to help me.
I saw him throw the rope. I saw a red bag a few feet from my head. I grabbed
it. It was my dry bag that had been beaten out of my boat by the thrashing
water. Dave’s throw had missed me. I threw the dry bag at Dave. The hole
gave me another dunking. Dave threw the rope again. This time he hit me
and pulled me to safety. Now only my boat was left to save. The boat bounced
and bobbed, rolled and turned, but it didn’t come out. Dave tried the patented
Branham “toss the rope into the cockpit and jerk the boat out” technique.
It didn’t work. I tried to get next to the hole and grab it. I couldn’t
reach it. We just hopelessly watched the hole have its way. Just as I was
about to give up and start walking, the hole grabbed the end of the boat,
sucked it into its yawning maw and appeared to swallow it completely. An
instant later, the hole burped and regurgitated it out and over the event
horizon and into the eddy where we grabbed it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A minute later, I was back aboard and paddling
downstream. Again I noticed that the boat was feeling sluggish, and I felt
water around my feet. I stopped to check things out. It was at this point
that we noticed the huge dent (as big as a soccer ball) in the back of
Dave’s boat and a foot long crack in the rear of mine. My boat was leaking
like a sieve. Half a roll of duct tape later we were again on our way.
We only had two miles of flat water to negotiate. My boat was leaking,
I was tired, I had somehow bruised some ribs, and we had a headwind. It
took forever. We made the takeout just before dark. I drove home, dumped
my gear in the garage, I think I ate, and then crawled into bed.</font>
