Carnage can be fun. On Shoal Creek and the East Fork we had fun aplenty.<BR>
<BR>
Shoal Creek had a large number of paddlers in the group, particularly for a micro-creek. I was sort of in charge,
having had the task delegated to me by Murray, who was off fishing or something. As we started out, Ken Peavahouse
asked me if I had any words of wisdom for the group. I said &quot;This is a creek, expect the unexpected.&quot;
The words had no sooner crossed my lips, than Ken was upside down; a few seconds later he was back upright, the
result of his first combat roll. I expected the unexpected, but I didn't expect the unexpected so soon and not
a double unexpected within a few seconds of making the &quot;expect the unexpected&quot; announcement.<BR>
<BR>
As we paddled downstream, we added new carnage to our bag of tricks. At one rapid, after I had luckily slithered
my boat through some tight spots, all the open boats, like lemmings into the sea, proceeded to follow me and pin
their boats, one after another, in exactly the same spot.     After the confluence with Whippoorwill creek, we
had a nice steep slide with a rather sticky hole at the bottom. Sure enough, one of the kayaks managed to get a
little bit sideways and zip he was stuck. John Reynolds, (Johnnie on the spot&quot; managed to get the paddler
out, but the boat was doing the extended dance in the hole. It took about ten or fifteen minutes before the hole
decided it had enough, released its hold, and gave the boat back.<BR>
<BR>
Good carnage can be great carnage if there are famous last words. Shoal Creek saved the best for last. I was sitting
in the &quot;eddy of last resort&quot; just above the last drop at the confluence with Scarham Creek, when Winfred
Stayton cruised up. I asked if he was going to run the last drop or take out. He said, &quot;I think I'll take
out here.&quot; I turned around just in time to see him running the drop backwards and upside down. &quot;Johnny
on the spot&quot; Reynolds was again there to pick up the pieces.  <BR>
