(C-1), Dave Curry (OC-1)</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;It was Thursday.&nbsp; The Bankhead
was being hammered with rain.&nbsp; Mark and I both had weaselly excuses
for not being able to paddle when the water was optimum: like work, or
picnics, or other insignificant (compared to paddling) reasons.&nbsp; By
Sunday, when we were able to make it, a lot of the water had already run
out.&nbsp; Fortunately, Hubbard Creek still had enough water (by Mark’s
prognostications) for a reasonable paddle.&nbsp; We headed for the headwaters
of the Sipsey.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The water at the put-in was pretty
low, not much more than a trickle, but we figured it was enough for adequate
lubrication on the big slide just a few hundred yards downstream and to
scrape the rest of the way to the Sipsey.&nbsp; We tossed the boats onto
the creek.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;We did a careful bank scout of the
25-foot high slide, which is called Kinlock Falls.&nbsp; Mark’s most important
goal was the placement of my camera for a good picture of him.&nbsp; Mark
had a smooth, straight down the gut run which produced a good picture.&nbsp;
For my run, I sideslipped a bit toward my on side, giving at least the
impression in the picture that I was side surfing my way down.&nbsp; In
this case, the picture was far more important than running the slide.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;From that point on, it was a 9-&frac12;
mile race to the takeout: a real cardio vascular workout.&nbsp; The Bankhead
scenery was spectacular and incredible: beautiful waterfalls on the side
creeks, clear water, rock overhangs, and fern covered cliffs.&nbsp; The
scent of magnolia blossoms filled the air.&nbsp; Even at the speed we were
traveling, we were able to take in a good bit of it.&nbsp; The only problems
we had between the put-in and the confluence with Thompson creek were several
massive logjams that had to be portaged.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Between Kinlock Falls and the takeout,
there is only one rapid of significance, Ship Rock Rapid, a pretty good
Class II/III chute between large boulders with a big rock at the bottom.&nbsp;
I caught the eddy on the left at the top and Mark grabbed the one on the
right.&nbsp; I went first, figuring I could run it straight down the left
and use what appeared to be a nice pillow of water to bounce off the rock
at the bottom.&nbsp; I got as far as the pillow; the rock grabbed me and
held me there while the creek proceeded to fill my boat with water.&nbsp;
I had to do quite a bit of rock bracing with paddle and hands to keep from
going for a swim.&nbsp; After what seemed like an eternity (actually about
3 seconds), I slid off the rock and into the eddy below with half a boat
of water.&nbsp; Mark saw my folly and ran to the right and had no problem,
but only after I had set up to take his picture.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The rest of the trip was uneventful.&nbsp;
It was just a long paddle through more spectacular scenery under perfect
weather conditions.&nbsp; The whole trip took less than four hours, including
time to scout Kinlock Falls and make at least two major portages around
logjams.&nbsp; On the way home, we made the obligatory stop at Lamar Marshall’s
store in Wren to look at the museum like exhibits and fill my comeback
cup with coffee.</font>
