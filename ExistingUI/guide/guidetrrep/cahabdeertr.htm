<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">At 275 cfs the Cahaba Deerfoot bridge run was quite pleasant
from deerfoot to I59 bridge with cool slides and no real hazards except for strainers.  350 cfs would be better
though and maybe more.  The short gorge section first drop in the run index picture was runnable but an immediate
portage is necessary.  The second part of the boulder jumble was unrunnable due to debris and low water.  The last
mile or so of the trip was unpleasant due to numerous portages around strainers.  Fun run, but definitely not worth
driving to from out of town, but fun to go down a new to me creek.</FONT></SPAN>
