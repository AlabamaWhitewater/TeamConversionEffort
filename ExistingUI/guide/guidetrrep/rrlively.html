<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many of you may remember Wednesday the
12th of December or the days that followed. The rains were beginning and
large accumulations were promised. My cell phone began to ring as excitement
was shared, speculations passed along the grapevine and plans made. I was
to join Mark D'Agostino on Thursday to paddle the Railroad Fork of Flint
Creek. Rain was pouring down as I drove to the meeting place when suddenly
I was sitting in a traffic jam on I-65. It took me 45 minutes to travel
10 miles and I arrived at Dairy Queen an hour late. [ed: I backed up exit
325, took Hwy 31 to where it was closed due to someone meeting their fate
via driving into Flint Creek, then had to drive the MIll Creek shuttle
just to arrive 15 minutes late.&nbsp; Wade never made it in time to meet
anyone!]&nbsp; I dashed in to interrogate the counter girls who had to
seen some guys with boats leave about 15 minutes earlier. I ran to the
car, Dave pulled up and we sped off to catch the others. At the put-in
was Mark’s truck was but there were no boaters. I had doubts but luckily
Dave was still confident about putting on and catching up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This run features nine tunnels that pass
under the railroad tracks. The first tunnel was low (~4 ft) but toward
the bottom the tunnels become cavernous. We passed through the first eight
tunnels over some class II water with a couple III’s mixed in. We spotted
our fellow paddlers at the entrance to tunnel 1 (numbered from the bottom
up). There is a fun rapid at the tunnel entrance but it is after you exit
this tunnel that the real amusement begins. We eddied on the left at the
tunnel exit and got out to scout. This half-mile section is continuous
slots and tight drops. It was a kind of pool-drop arrangement with very
very short pools, making division into distinct rapids almost irrelevant.
It provides constant thrills, requires the ability to catch small eddies,
and has some notable consequences. However, the water isn’t too pushy and
all of the rapids can be scouted with little difficulty. I think we hit
the creek at the perfect level, in the midst of a serious rain. Railroad
Fork is an unusual experience that I absolutely recommend if you can catch
it when it’s running. Most importantly for me it provided a dose of confidence
and a nice prelude to the adventures on Friday.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The rains continued Thursday night, painting
Mark’s flow-page blue. We set off to paddle on the north end of Sand Mountain.
Lively had been described as nothing more than III+ but when we arrived
the banks were full and no one seemed sure what to expect. Dave Curry,
with wisdom and serenity I obviously lack, decided to pass and kindly ran
shuttle for us. In retrospect the rapids on the first mile were probably
not that difficult, in the II-III range, but they were nonstop, coming
one after another after another. The others paddled like they were enjoying
a whitewater dream come true, but I was nervous, my paddling was sloppy,
and my dream threatened to become a nightmare. Due to the continuous nature
of the rapids and the reptilian survival mode of my brain I can only recall
a few of the rapids distinctly. In the second mile there was a double drop
with sticky looking holes on river right and a 14-foot waterfall which
pumped enough adrenaline into my system to quiet my nerves and allow me
to enjoy the river.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After the second mile we picked up more
water, the holes got bigger, and the complexity of the rapids increased.
Most of the rapids were in the III-IV+ range. I walked several but others
ran all but one large drop with a sieve about halfway through. In the last
couple miles the length of the run and the portages we taking their toll,
I was just following the person in front of me and trying to stay upright.
We made it to a convenient takeout thanks entirely to Brian's GPS. Lively
creek at the level we paddled is a large step above anything else on my
resume. Its length, six miles of almost uninterrupted whitewater excitement,
precludes the look at a rapid, drink some water, discuss the rapid, tempo
to which I’d grown accustomed. Thanks to the encouragement of my fellow
paddlers Lively was an intensely enjoyable adventure but, at least for
me, another run would still be an intimidating prospect. As you would expect
Mark has good descriptions of these runs, pictures, and directions to the
put-ins on his web site.</font>
