<p class=MsoNormal>THE BEST CLASS II TRIP IN ALABAMA AND I CAN GUARANTEE THAT
YOU HAVEN’T PADDLED IT YET!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By Murray Carroll</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, I know that’s an awfully big statement to make in this
esteemed journal that equates to the gospel for north Alabama paddlers, but I
believe that we have all overlooked the best Class II in the state.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Several years ago, Mark D’ made a first HCC
trip down the “Upper, Upper, Upper Mulberry” (Highway 67 to U.S. Highway 278)
and since then it has become a favorite of Huntsville boaters who don’t like
the steeper style of creek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact I’m
also fond of that run, but I believe now that we have found a creek in the same
neighborhood that has much more whitewater but doesn’t intimidate beginning
paddlers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a long hiatus from boating brought about by a
combination of a heart attack, starting a weekend business and my weakness for
bass fishing, I decided to take advantage of this extremely wet early winter
and lead a trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I watched the river
levels for about two weeks and decided to give the Duck River between Cullman
and Arab a shot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark D’ had the run
listed in his Alabama Whitewater paddling guide, but he and Dave Curry had only
ran a section of the river south of U.S. Highway 278.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>He had photos and a brief description of the run above Hwy. 278
based on reports from Birmingham paddlers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Mark advised that he was not impressed with the section that he had
paddled and thought that we should try the section from County Road 1669 to
Hwy. 278.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The level was 4.8 feet on the
gauge and the time had come to make this trip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was able to recruit a small crew to make this first HCC
descent of this section on the Sunday following the HCC Christmas Party.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The brave souls all were paddling open
canoes and included Bob and Brenda Barnett, Chris Phillips, Brenda Collins,
Orrin Long, Kay and myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The put-in
at County Road 1669 has parking for about 4 cars and the access is fairly
easy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The run down to an intermediate
bridge at County Road 1651 could best be described as nearly continuous shoals
with good moving water between the closely spaced shoals.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At County Road 1651 the topography changed
dramatically and steep bluffs began to line the river.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From County Road 1651 to U.S. Hwy.278 the
river features gave way to more actual drops and light rapids mixed with some
shoals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I couldn’t guess how many
shoals and rapids are on this run, but you’re never bored nor will most
paddlers be intimidated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The run passes
through what appears to be total wilderness, but you know that the chicken
houses must be just out of sight beyond the bluffs and trees.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The run ends at the Hwy. 278 bridge take-out
that’s none too easy, but is not as bad as a lot that I know of.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beware of a few downed trees on the run; I believe that we
had to portage about two or three.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One
of the trees was at the lower end of a blind-turn rapid and blocked the
egress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thankfully a good eddy was
located just upstream of the downed timber; it saved the day for us.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, I’ve made the claim that this is the best Class II in
the state and I’ll stand by the statement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Be sure to make the run before the Cullman dam builders start moving
dirt and cutting trees.</p>
