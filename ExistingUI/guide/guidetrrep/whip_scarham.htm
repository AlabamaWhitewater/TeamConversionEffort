<p class=MsoNormal>Trip Report</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scarham Creek - June 14, 1997</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dave Curry</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adventures on Sand Mountain --Mark D'Agostino, Ben Ferrill,
David Curry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mark D’ was desperate for a
fix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All his usual connections had
deserted him, and Mary had too much wedding stuff to do to attend to his
needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He dug deep into his Rolodex to
call Ben and me to ask if we were up to a learning experience (translation:
humbling experience).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Little did I know
how much learning would be experienced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We met at Hardees on a rainy
Saturday to decide where to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
Little River in the Smokies was out --too much water.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We considered The Plateau -—way too much water.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can run the Ocoee any time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That left Sand Mountain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>At the top of the mountain, we
started checking out creeks:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Black Oak
--not enough water;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Town --Mark had
already paddled it this year;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Short
--too much of a learning experience;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>South Sauty --out of the question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>That left Scarham.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At Double
Bridges, things really looked nasty;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>the level was high and the confluence with Whippoorwill creek was a
boiling, seething, writhing mass of &quot;funny&quot; water.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark said it was perfect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We put onto Whippoorwill creek and
had an idyllic, enjoyable paddle to the confluence.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>From that point on, the creek began to drop rapidly, and the
velocity and push of the water increased dramatically.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We scouted and paddled the first few rapids
without event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then, at the top of a
rather long rapid, I lost a wrestling match with a bush in an eddy (there were
no kayaks available) and ended up swimming without my boat.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I had no choice but to hike, paddle in hand,
hoping my boat was smart enough to swim safely to shore.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>About two hundred yards down stream it had neatly broached itself on
some rocks on the opposite bank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark
and I tandem-ferried across the creek and everything was back to normal.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ben would not fare quite so
well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In trying to run a scary drop
which Mark had made look easy, and I had walked, Ben got separated from his
boat, had his paddle jerked out of his hand, and got re-circulated a couple of
times by a hungry hole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Luckily, Mark
hit a perfect throw with his rope and Ben was safely ashore without having to
swim the Class V rapid just below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He
only had a messy contusion on his leg which Mark repaired with duct tape.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His boat and paddle, however, were well on
their way to Guntersville.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>With Ben hiking and Mark and me
paddling, we began the search for Ben's boat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The creek was not so steep now, but the waves and holes were getting
bigger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the confluence with Short
Creek and as far as you could see below was an enormous wave/hole extravaganza
that looked more like the North Atlantic than a creek in Alabama.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A couple hundred yards below the
confluence, we found Ben's boat neatly broached on a rock about 50 feet from
shore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark immediately took charge of
the recovery effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After three trips
back to my boat for the right equipment, (&quot;you don't have a `biner
attached to your rope?&quot;) we were set.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Mark and I held one end of the rope while Ben made the swim to the boat
with the other end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the second try,
he made it, and easily popped the boat free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>All our troubles were over, or so we thought. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Earlier in the day, Mark had
casually mentioned that there was a &quot;bit of a flat water paddle&quot; to
the take-out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The three miles of flat
water was no problem at all;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the 20 mph
wind in our faces was, however a bit of a problem.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It was a strain all the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, my spine is now made of
pure titanium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When I got home, I ate supper, took
a double dose of vitamin I, crawled into bed, and slept the untroubled sleep of
the exhausted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The next morning I awoke
to find that all my limbs were intact and I could still walk.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I guess it really was a good learning
experience.</p>
