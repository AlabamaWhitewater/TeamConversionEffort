Beautiful country. Towering bluffs on both sides of the river. Arrived at about 11 am and the water level on the
gauge on the bridge marker was at 6&quot;. The USGS water gauge showed 3.05 ft. Decided to go on and try it anyway
after driving 3 hours to get there. Put in at 12:15 and set out. I recommend a water level at the bridge 1 ft min.
At level of 6&quot; be ready to drag your boat about 75% of the time. Our intentions were to paddle to Hurricane
creek (about half way to highway 33) and camp on the rivers edge. On arrival to Hurricane creek we decided to make
a run for the truck at highway 33 or get as far down the river as we could. We made Caney Creek at about 6:30 and
decided to set up camp before dark. The next morning broke camp and continued on. Same thing to the take out. No
water. If you could catch the water between 2 and 3 feet this run would be a hoot. Great one day trip. One section
at about mile 6 called the 100 yard dash would be a good class II run at about 2 to 3 ft. Lots of undercut bluffs
to paddle under. Saw 3 cotton mouths and a Blue Heron. I would definitely recommend this trip for any level paddler.
Just needed more water. We talked to a Forest Ranger and he said that in case of rain the water level will rise
and fall quickly. - Carl Wilson, Oxford, AL</FONT></SPAN>
