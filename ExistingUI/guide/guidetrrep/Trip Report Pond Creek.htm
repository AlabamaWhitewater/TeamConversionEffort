<p class=MsoNormal>Trip Report – Pond Creek</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>September 11, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mark D’Agostino (C-1), Dave Curry (OC-1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By Dave Curry</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mark called me at about 11:30 AM on
Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It had just stopped raining in
Muscle Shoals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pond Creek might be
up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was ordered to get my stuff
together and meet post-haste.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was
“new water” with waterfalls and we couldn’t miss the opportunity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I dutifully loaded the Whitesell on my car
and met him by 1:30 PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>By 3:00 we were looking for the
put-in and takeout.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a couple of
passes, we figured out where the creek was and made a good guess at the
take-out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The put-in was easy to
find.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was just off the road at the
confluence of the creek with about 50CFS of toxic waste from a factory on
opposite side of the road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It looked
like we had enough water so we unloaded and got ready.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The factory
effluent ran down a pretty steep slide into the creek from its outlet
pipe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark initially wanted to run it,
until he noticed it was full of broken rock and rebar.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We changed our minds and lowered our boats
to the creek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was just enough
water to keep from scraping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The creek
was just barely wide enough to turn the Whitesell around to catch an eddy; this
would prove to be a bit of a problem later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The first
rapid consisted of a lengthy tunnel wit a horizon line at the end.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I climbed out (with camera in hand) and
scrambled over the top to check things out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It was an 18-foot waterfall into a nice clean (obstruction-wise) pool.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I yelled back up the tunnel for Mark to come
on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He ran the falls cleanly while I
dutifully took his picture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I lowered
the camera to him and dutifully followed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The next
rapid was an even longer tunnel with a similar horizon line at the end.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I barely turned around in the creek, caught
the “eddy of last resort” and held onto a rock to keep from washing into the
tunnel backwards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The tunnel was really
long, the climb up looked difficult, and I couldn’t get out of my boat very
easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark thought about if for a
little while and then paddled down the tunnel and disappeared over the horizon
line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I saw him give the OK sign with
his paddle; he then gave me some “mixed signals” as to what to do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I knew he was OK, but I couldn’t tell
whether he wanted me to come ahead, stop, run left, or run right.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I thought about it for a few seconds and
then peeled out and into the tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>When I hit the drop, I heard some crunching and grinding and got kicked
around by some rocks on the way down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It was nasty, but I made it safely to the bottom without pinning.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All-in-all, it was probably easier to run it
than make the portage through the briars in shorts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The rest of
the way was pretty easy with a few more uneventful waterfalls to run and some
shoals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The creek was remarkably devoid
of play spots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The carryout is about
400 yards, all uphill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The paddler’s guide on
AlabamaWhitewater.com rates Pond as a “2 chicken” creek for cleanliness.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My estimate was closer to 4 or 5
chickens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It might even qualify as a
“Super Fund” site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>[Mark: “My bad,
the number of the counting shall be three”]</p>
