It was the &quot;Burly&quot; Bear, for sure. I don't know what the level was when we put on, but a check of the
gauge around 11:00 showed it to already be at one foot and rising. It continued to rain for the next 2 hours until
we put on around 1:00. My best guess is it was somewhere between 2.5 and 3 feet. <BR>
<BR>
Some of the soundbites from the day: <BR>
<BR>
Dalton: &quot;It's class 3.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Dalton: &quot;You want it to be high. It's not running if it isn't high.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Rett: &quot;MarkD is very comfortable on this run.&quot; (No offense MarkD, but most 4-5 boaters around the state
know that if your write up says you like it, then they will too.) <BR>
<BR>
Willerson: &quot;My head's all fuckered up, now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Alex: &quot;That rapid sucked my helmet off.&quot; (It literally did.) <BR>
<BR>
Rett: &quot;Well, Mason, you could let it heal up without stiches, but the scar is going to be a lot bigger.&quot;
(Needless to say, the day ended with Dr. Blake stitching up Mason's chin on the tailgate of his truck.) <BR>
<BR>
Dalton: &quot;This is what you get when you underestimate class 3.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Alex: &quot;Well, Burke's boat was already cracked, so it was probably the least valuable thing he had with him.&quot;
(Be on the lookout for an orange/yellow Nomad.) <BR>
<BR>
The three big slides were HUGE and super fast. Everything in between was a blur. But Dalton was &quot;droppin it
like it's hot&quot; and the rest of us were just following closely (maybe a little too close) behind. Anyhow, all's
well that ends well. <BR>
<BR>
I've never seen so much water on Lookout Mountain. Everything was flooding. Johnnies must have hit close to 2 feet
itself. If you get out on Johnnies today or tomorrow, be on the lookout for any boulders that may have shifted
and new wood. <BR>

&quot;It's only class V when your upside down&quot; Dalton <BR>
<BR>
My jaws are sore today because I flat wore out a piece of juicy fruit!<BR>
