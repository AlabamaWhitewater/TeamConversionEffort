(OC-1), Mark D’Agostino (C-1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We had a
pretty good rain Sunday night and Monday morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Mark called me on Monday afternoon with instructions to pack my
gear for a crack-of-dawn departure on Tuesday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The destination:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>fresh-meat runs
on a pair of creeks in the Sylacauga area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I was directed to load the Whitesell so I wouldn’t chicken out if the
rapids got tough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When he showed up at
my house at 6:30AM with a Cascade and not the new Nomad in the back of his
truck I knew we were in for unknown and possibly dicey waters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>By 9:30AM
we were looking over the side of a bridge on Highway 22; the Swamp Creek
takeout.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The creek was small and the
flow looked low, but adequate. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>After a
quick change into our dry suits (which would not come off for over 6 hours) and
a short shuttle, we were paddling on flat water.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>According to Mark, from his studies of satellite imagery, there
was supposed to be a couple of miles of whitewater in the middle of the 9 mile
run.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>He assured me that it was
whitewater and not just piles of white scum from hog farms.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>After the first mile, we began to get a few
Class I riffles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A bit further
downstream, the sandstone rocks gave way to granite and the rapids got a bit
better including a couple of drops of about 4 feet.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>A short stretch of flat-water ended with a dam that required a
short portage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Below the dam were a steep
slide with a drop at the end and a good stretch of decent Class II rapids.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We thought the creek would end up with about
5 miles of flat water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Luckily, Mark
had overestimated the length of the run and it turned out to be only 3 miles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>By 1:30PM
we were on the road running shuttle and heading for the second run of the day:
Socapatoy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was no time to stop
for lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had to eat on the
move.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The shuttle was fairly long and
required about a five mile drive on dirt roads; so much for my freshly washed
car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>According
to Mark, Socapatoy has about a mile of whitewater in the middle of a 4 mile
run.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The creek was running swiftly and
the flow seemed adequate so we jumped on and headed into the unknown.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sure enough, a little over a mile into the
run, we began to encounter Class I-II rapids.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>Just like Swamp, the rocks changed from sandstone to granite, with some
huge boulders in the stream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a
couple of good Class III slides, we came around a bend to view a distinct
horizon line and some big boulders almost completely blocking the stream.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I skirted a big rock, caught an eddy on
river right, and climbed out of my boat to get a good look at what was
downstream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What I saw made me glad I
was paddling my “Big Red Security Blanket,” the Whitesell.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The rapid started with a big curving slide
into a generous pool; below that was a giant boulder garden that seemed to go
on forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a brief discussion on
the entry to the slide, Mark readied the camera and I took the plunge.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The slide was actually easier than it
looked, and I remembered to pull my elbows in as I rocketed past the boulder at
the bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I climbed out and got some
pictures of Mark’s run.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The boulder
garden turned out to be a fairly easy eddy-hop with a bit of “bump-and-scrape”
along the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More stream-flow would
have made it a bit easier. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a few
more shoals and some flat water, we were at the confluence with Hatchet creek
and the final mile of swift moving flat water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After a
speedy shuttle and a 3 hour drive we were home by 8:00PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Both creeks
were fun paddles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our day would have
been a lot more interesting if there had been more water.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The level on Hatchet creek (the closest USGS
gauge) was about 900 CFS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think
1500-2000 CFS would have made things better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
