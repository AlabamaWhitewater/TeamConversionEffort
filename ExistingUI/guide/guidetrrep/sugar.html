<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sugar Creek</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">13 September 1998</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">by: Bob Barnett</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As everyone knows July and August was very
hot and dry, with the annual rainfall running minus eight inches below
normal. Our scheduled trip for September was supposed to have been on the
Flint River, but having scouted the river the week before I concluded that
it was too low to run. I had planned to announce the cancellation of the
trip at the club meeting, but after talking with Nancy Patterson about
Sugar Creek, which she had done a couple of weeks earlier, we decided to
put plan B into motion and meet at Captain D’s in Madison at 9:00 AM Saturday.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was surprised at the number of people
that showed up, all of which would be paddling tandem canoes. The adventurers
included Nancy Patterson and Lee Hollingsworth, (new members) Steve and
Evlon McElyea, and their friends (Jim and Alida Nix, (new member) Annora
Day and her friend from Russia Katya Kolovskaya, Mike and Kathy Campbell,
Jim Robertson, myself and grandson Chris. I had obtained some good maps
of the area and after talking with the manager of Captain D’s, who came
out to greet us after all those vehicles with canoes on top started filling
up his parking area, told me that he crosses Elk River every day on US
72 and that the river was really low. After studying the maps I decided
that Nancy’s original put in might be affected by the low backwater of
Elk River which confluence’s with Sugar Creek, so we decided to go to plan
C and put in two bridges above where Nancy and Lee had put in. Playing
follow the leader we headed out for Sugar Creek about fifteen miles northwest
of Athens. On one occasion I missed the turn and created a figure eight
with our caravan, making me feel like the pied piper as we met ourselves.
I don’t feel comfortable leading a large group to places and rivers I haven’t
had a chance to check out, I apologize for the confusion. When we arrived
at the take out where we left our schedule vehicle, I was relieved to look
upstream and see a beautiful little pristine creek that was floatable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The put in for this float was on AL Highway
99 and the takeout was on Cotton Belt Road. This section of the river is
short scenic three hour float. I have been told that with adequate water
levels you can put in about twenty miles up stream in Tennessee. Sugar
Creek is a beautiful little stream with a gravel bottom, running through
bottom land and around hillsides. There is an abundance of baitfish and
crawfish making this potentially an excellent float fishing trip. As our
group spread out with the Campbell’s in the lead and myself bringing up
the rear, it was relaxing to paddle along enjoying the serenity of the
river. There was a couple of places where we had to portage over shoals
and one place where a log jam had formed as the creek split to flow around
an island, giving Nancy and lee the opportunity to practice their newly
acquired self rescue skills. As we rounded the end of the island, Nancy
said “I’ve been here before, this is where we paddled upstream two weeks
ago.” Neat place! As the water flowed around the end of the island and
over the last shoal, it formed a natural water slide and play pool that
several of us took advantage of. We shoved off and rounded the next bend
and to our surprise the take out bridge came into view ending another good
day on the river. Thanks to everyone for their participation, keep your
paddles wet and I’ll see you next tim</font>e.
