By Dave Curry</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 10pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">Ben Ferrill (OC-1), Ken Pevahouse (OC-1), Dave Curry (OC-1),
Kurt Ruffing (K-1), and three kayakers from Louisville.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 10pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">Ken had scheduled a trip down the Upper Mulberry earlier in
the week.&nbsp; After arriving at the put-in, we realized that as a result of the overnight rains the river was
almost totally blown out of its banks.&nbsp; On my suggestion, we decided to avoid a high-speed flat-water paddle
and look upstream for more interesting water.&nbsp; We decided to put on the river at Highway 278 just outside
Holly Pond.&nbsp; As Ben and I were driving along the highway, we spied a small creek (Mud Creek) that passed under
the roadway through a couple of pipes.&nbsp; In the spirit of Mark, (“new water is good water”), we were required
to check it out.&nbsp; After a quick examination to determine that we could get the boats down the first hundred
yards or so and a more careful examination of the Gazetteer to make sure that the creek ran into the Mulberry,
we started unloading boats.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 10pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">As we were getting ready, a car with kayaks on the roof pulled
up and the driver asked if they could join us.&nbsp; We let them know we were stepping into the unknown but were
quite willing to let them come along.&nbsp; Four kayaks and three open boats ventured off into the void.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 10pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">At what I guessed to be about 75-100 CFS, Mud Creek proved
to be about 2 &frac12; miles of fun Class I-II paddling with very few obstructions or bottom scraping along the
way.&nbsp; We only had a few logs that required either a contorted “limbo” to get under or a little speed to get
over.&nbsp; The creek’s gradient was fairly constant.&nbsp; There were two or three good Class II rapids and a
number of Class I shoals punctuated with only short sections of moving flat water.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we arrived
all too soon at the confluence with a muddy, bloated Mulberry Fork.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 10pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">We had about five miles of mostly swift moving flat water
punctuated with occasional rapids that consisted primarily of large wave trains.&nbsp; There were a few trees down
in the river that had to be paddled around.&nbsp; We had a few pretty good waves for surfing along the way.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 10pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">What started out as a fairly warm day grew colder and colder
as the afternoon wore on.&nbsp; By the time we got to the takeout, I was thoroughly chilled and ready to head for
home.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 10pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">All in all, it wasn’t a bad trip.&nbsp; At least the Mud Creek
section added a little adventure.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 10pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">To paddle Mud Creek, you need major rains the night before
and a level of at least 5000 CFS at the Garden City gauge on the Mulberry Fork.&nbsp; If the rapid at the put-in
on the creek appears to have enough water to run without scraping, the level is adequate.&nbsp; The put-in is about
mid-way between Holly Pond and the Mulberry Fork Bridge on highway 278.&nbsp; There is no bridge over the creek,
it passes under the highway through large pipes. <BR>
