<p class=MsoNormal>On July 1, 2003, I came home to Eastaboga for the 4<sup>th</sup>
of July holiday from my summer job at Camp McDowell.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Coincidentally, Tropical Storm Bill came through Alabama that
same day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I didn’t have any of my gear
with me, so my brother Wes graciously let me borrow his, and we headed over to
Cheaha Creek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I had hiked the Silent
Trail that runs along the creek a few times previously, but never this close to
such a big rain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We parked at the lake
and hiked up the ½ mile or so to the top of the Six Pack.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was good to go, so I got dressed while
Wes set up at the bottom of the first drop with camera and rope.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I am forever indebted to Wes for running
safety, taking pictures, and letting me borrow his gear to boot!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I ran the first drop far river left, ducking
under a mountain laurel at the top.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
second drop was good fun, and I ran it pretty much down the middle (first
picture).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since I was in a playboat, I
was greeted with a bit of a backender at the bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The next drop was a sloping ledge that I ran on the far left
(second picture) with another backender at the bottom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Soon I was at the big boy, Devil’s Den
(third picture).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of the water goes
over the middle onto rocks, and maybe you could ferry across to run it off the
left, which had good water, but I was not up to it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>At the level that day there was a barely boat-wide line on the
right angling back toward the middle that was good as long as you hit it just
right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I totally botched it the second
time I tried, but no pain followed, so it’s a safe line.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After Devil’s Den is an awesome 7 foot
boof<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(4<sup>th</sup> picture) followed
quickly by another 4 foot drop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The top
drop is best boofed angling a little bit right.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The last drop of the Six Pack was possibly one the most fun
rapids I’ve ever run.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s really long
(by my standards) and really fast and fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The ‘speedway’ name works well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>You can’t tell how much this rapid drops from the trail, because the
viewpoint is far up on the ridge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But
it’s a whole lotta fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The rest of the
creek down to the lake was really fun too, really tight, creeky class
II-III.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was one of the best days of
paddling ever for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A beautiful 85
degree day in July with cool clean water and fun drops that I’d been wanting to
run for at least a year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thanks
Tropical Storm Bill.</p>
