<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Four paddlers, Mark
D’Agostino, Gary Holder, Doug Klaras, and David Curry had the unique pleasures
of paddling one of the best Class III+ creeks in the area under almost
perfect conditions. The weather was warm, around 65 degrees with no wind
and a clear blue sky. The water level was around 400CFS, a nice level for
good technical paddling. Town creek is almost continuous Class III drop/pool
rapids with nice drops of around three to five feet.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">The run starts at
the base of High Falls, one of the most spectacular cascades in the Southeast,
complete with natural bridge. In the middle of the run there is a rather
lengthy portage around the Class VI rapid, The Blockage. This rapid is
a congested boulder field with several blind cut throughs and ends with
the entire creek converging to an eight-foot waterfall that lands on top
of a rock. Mark showed his aversion to carrying his boat by running the
first two thirds of the rapid with Gary running safety for him on the shore.
He came to his senses before the last drop, took his boat out and carried
it around the rest of the rapid. On previous trips we have been treated
with at least one eagle sighting. We came up short on the eagles, but did
see at least one kingfisher. The trip was so enjoyable that even the flatwater
paddle and half mile uphill takeout didn’t seem all that bad.</font></font>
