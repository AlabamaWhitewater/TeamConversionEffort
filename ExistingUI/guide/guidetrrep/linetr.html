<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Trip Report</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Line Creek – June5, 2001.&nbsp; Mark D’Agostino
(C-1), Dave Curry (OC-1).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;“It’s 7:03, you’re wasting cubes!”&nbsp;
That was the message on my office answering machine when I walked in at
7:04AM.&nbsp; I immediately returned Mark’s call.&nbsp; I was told to get
my ducks in order and meet him in 5 minutes, the creek was running down
and we had to get there post-haste.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; In a few minutes, we were barreling
down Highway 231 as fast as the Dasher’s little wheels could turn.&nbsp;
Our destination, Line Creek, flows off the southeast side of Sand Mountain,
just down the road from Sardis, if you know where that is.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;We checked the level at the take-out.&nbsp;
It looked a bit low, but we figured we could get down it if we got started
quickly.&nbsp; After changing clothes and a short shuttle we had the boats
on the water and were scraping downstream on about a 20CFS trickling creek.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The first mile was awful.&nbsp;
We broach-hopped from rock to rock and shoal to shoal.&nbsp; Mark’s quote
of the day: “This would be fun if it didn’t suck so bad.”&nbsp; As we moved
downstream, the creek got a bit steeper and began to channel down somewhat
and a few small feeder creeks began to add at least a bit of volume to
things.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The second mile was considerably
better, at least in a relative sense.&nbsp; It consisted mostly of a large
number of slides and drops.&nbsp; It was a bit like running a dozen Powell
Falls at 50CFS (we dragged a bit).&nbsp; Some of the slides were near vertical
and were even at least a little bit technical.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;At the beginning of the third mile
we climbed out to scout and photograph an interesting triple drop that
was a total of about 15 feet.&nbsp; Mark made me climb up the bank and
hang precariously just so I could get a good picture of him running the
third drop.&nbsp; From there down, the paddling got considerably better.&nbsp;
At one point, all the water flowed into a tunnel between two big rocks
and into a massive undercut with a Class III drop at the end of it.&nbsp;
Mark thinks this place may be called the Icebox.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some
trees were jammed between the rocks, so we had to portage about half the
rapid.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The last mile was a hoot.&nbsp;
It consisted of several Class III-IV rapids that varied from a five-foot
drop with some pinning potential to several slot rapids that were pretty
technical in nature.&nbsp; I was happy because, with the volume as low
as it was, there was absolutely no push at all.&nbsp; You could paddle
up to a drop, look over the edge and then either push or paddle back if
you didn’t like the looks of it.&nbsp; The only thing bad about the last
mile was it was over too quickly.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;With a little bit more water, Line
Creek should be a real gem.</font>
