<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Trip Report</b> – South Sauty,
December 20, 2002</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Dave Curry</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Mark
D’Agostino (C-1), Ken Pevahouse (OC-1), Dave Curry (OC-1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Mark
had been trying to get me on South Sauty for over a year.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I used every weenie excuse I could come up
with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Apprehension towards rapids with
legendary names like Jonah’s Whale, The Slot, the Mine Fields, and Bone Crusher
were driving my fear factor higher than its normal sky-high level.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark, however, was his typical bulldog
persistent self, and I eventually ran out of excuses and capitulated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
we got to the gauge at the takeout, the level was 1.7 feet, somewhat higher
than Mark would have liked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He
bolstered my confidence by telling me that it wouldn’t be all that pushy, he
knew all the lines and would hold my hand all the way, and I should be able to
handle it, more or less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’d heard this
tale from Mark before, and, just like before, I fell for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At
the put-in, Mark and The Peve decided to run the first drop.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I looked at the 8-foot long log going round
and round in the pool and decided to take the “sissy option” and put in below
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark said the log just added a
Russian roulette element.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They both ran
it without incident. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
first half of the run, we had no problems, just fun.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The creek was pushy, the rapids long, and the holes were big, but
everything was pretty well manageable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We bank scouted the first major rapid, Welcome to Sauty.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is a huge flat area to the left of the
rapid where Mark said he wanted to have his wedding ceremony (Mary had control
of that social event and had it in church).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The rapid was pretty straight forward: just peel out, ferry to river
right, avoid the big rock in the middle at the top, and work left to avoid the
monster undercut at the bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At
Jonah’s Whale, I used my patented “boat assisted portage” technique to scrape
down the rocks on the opposite bank to avoid the hungry grasp of the whale’s
mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At Cliff Left, I sort of messed
up by going to the right around the Mushroom Rock, but squeezed through the
slot in good shape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Peve, who was
also making his first run, was having a great time bouncing over the holes and
through the waves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark was doing a
good job of showing us the lines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After
lunch we hit the really tough stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Drunken Horseman was easily boat scouted by sitting in the eddy next to
the rapid and looking over the rock right next to the drop.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Both Minefields were long and tough; they
required catching the necessary eddies, making the right moves, and keeping the
boat pointed downstream to avoid being “window-shaded” by one of the zillion
big holes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Peve and I both did OK,
although I did spend a bit of time going sideways in the Lower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At
the Slot, things began to get a bit messy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Mark said it didn’t need scouting; all you have to do is enter the slot
in the right place, and the rapid will take care of everything for you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Peve and I were sitting in the eddy
while Mark went round and round in circles trying to decide how to enter the
Slot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was getting antsy and started
nagging him to hurry up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He gave me a
dirty look and turned his boat downstream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The current turned his boat to the right and the last thing we heard was
the staccato rattle of his paddle as he rock-braced his way down the right hand
side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I followed, but further to the
left; I heard a grinding noise as the rocket-alloy gunwales of the Whitesell
cut a groove in the rocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Luckily, I
managed to stay straight and the rapid did its thing with me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I paddled downstream, I started looking
for Mark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I eventually saw him standing
on the bank draining the water from his boat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He had flipped just below the Slot and after about ten roll attempts had
“pulled the plug.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He yelled at me to
look upstream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Peve was following
his lead and bouncing over the ledges on his side.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Mark threw him a rope and all was well.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We had a
brief Class III+ no-name breather before Bone Crusher, which I had planned to
sneak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark and I ran the short entry
rapid and were sitting in a “truck-stop” eddy when The Peve blew past us on the
left with half a boat full of water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
saw him disappear round the bend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was
sure he was swimming by then and Mark and I gave chase.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We caught a couple of tiny eddies on the
left just above the really nasty stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>From there we could see Ken safe and sound about 100 yards
downstream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I realized then that I had
screwed up running the sneak and had to run the meat.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It looked fairly simple: slide just to the left of the big
pour-over, get right quickly to avoid the two massive bone crushing boulders,
and then just bounce over the drops while avoiding the holes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I did OK on the first part.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I skimmed past the pour-over and started to
get right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In my efforts, I got spun
around by a small hole and was facing upstream.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I wasn’t sure I could turn the Whitesell back downstream before I
got my face smashed on the rocks, so I just ferried to the right and ran most
of the rapid backwards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Somehow, just
like The Peve, I made it safely to the bottom.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We had
only a couple of miles of Class III+ whitewater to go.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was time for sightseeing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mark pointed out several important sites,
such as the place where Chris Parker trashed the nose of his boat, several
places where Dave Branham had messed up a boat, and near the end, the spot
where he (Mark) pinned his boat; see the Alabama Whitewater web page for
photographic evidence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When I at
last saw the Buck’s Pocket ranger station, I would have twirled my paddle in
exuberance, but I was too tired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was
a long run and I was glad to have made it in one piece.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I just might want to run it again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>[Dave
has since run it up to seven times a year, and I think he has still yet to have
any swims, nor has he run the put-in rapid]</p>
