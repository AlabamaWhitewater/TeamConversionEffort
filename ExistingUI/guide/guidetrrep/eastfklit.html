<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As many of you know, Huntsville Canoe Club
swaps newsletters with several neighboring canoe clubs. I have made a habit
of reading these newsletters whenever I can obtain them. Some really good
pieces appear in other club's newsletters and we reprint them in our newsletter
when they are of interest to us here in Huntsville. One of my favorite
newsletters is from the Tennessee Valley Canoe Club, based in Chattanooga.
Through the years, one name kept appearing as the trip leader for overnighters,
John Alden. I called John three years ago and got his advice on water levels
on the Toccoa River before our HCC overnighter on that small river. In
February of this year I obtained the TVCC newsletter and saw that John
was planning to lead a canoe camping trip on the East Fork of the Little
River (Al); I waited until a few weeks before the trip and called John
and asked if Kay and I could accompany him down the river. John said that
he would be happy to have us on the trip.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The East Fork of the Little River is one
of the two major tributaries to the Little River on Lookout Mountain. Many
of us in the club have paddled the canyon and Mark D' led a trip down the
West Fork this spring, but no one in the club had paddled the East Fork.
John paddled the East Fork the preceeding Thursday, more than a week prior
to the trip at around 900 cfs (Little River at Blue Hole; a long way and
a lot of tributaries downstream) and reported the river low but runnable.
In the days prior to our trip the river fell, rose slightly again and then
began another fall to around 750 cfs on Thursday; things weren't looking
too good. Just like clockwork, the heavy thunderstorms poured into the
area on Friday and the river was running around 1700 cfs by Saturday morning.
We met John Alden and Lois Newton (TVCC's newsletter editor) at Valley
Head and were joined by Don and Judy Bodley along with their friend Carter
at the put-in near Mentone. Our group was made up of two tandem crews and
three solo boats.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The put-in is below the dam at Lake Lahusage,
a rustic dam with a partial road across the top. The action begins immediately
and doesn't let up until the East Fork joins the West Fork 8.3 miles downstream.
It is a drop/ pool river, but the current moves nicely through the short
pools. Most of the shoals and rapids are Class II, but at least two would
rate a mild Class III rating. Foshee's guidebook notes 48 shoals and rapids
in the section from Lake Lahusage to the confluence and I would say that
is fairly accurate. This first day of the overnight trip is as much as
most anyone would want to run with a boat loaded with camping gear. We
had no swims on this section, unlike TVCC's 1997 trip when three out of
six boats swam (the water was much higher last year). We camped at a really
nice site at the confluence of the East and West Forks; ate a leisurely
dinner and then indulged in a TVCC tradition; playing Trivial Pursuit,
men vs. women. Naturally the men soundly thrashed the gals at the game.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Day two of the trip was a float down the
remaining 6.3 miles of river to the takeout on Highway 35. The float was
on the clear waters of Little River; this section is only Class I, with
one Class II drop, but it flows swiftly and you're back in civilization
entirely too fast. After camping on some of the top overnighter rivers
in the Southeast, I would rate this at the top for really interesting whitewater.
Not nearly as beautiful as some such as Big South Fork Canyon, this has
them all beat when it comes to a challange.</font>
