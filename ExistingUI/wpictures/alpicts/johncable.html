<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I'd heard there was a big flood around LRC in 1985 where several bridges were
washed out.&nbsp; Possibly the dam on Upper Johnnies was even breached. Here is a picture of the cable bridge that
used to span the last rapid.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Stephen Brewer continues:  &quot;It was taken probably about 1983.  The fellow
in the picture is my wife’s step uncle.  His name is Buddy Weeks.  The bridge was anchored on each end with steel
poles sunk into large rocks.  I’m not absolutely certain if it is the same rock, but there is a large rock maybe
&frac14; mile downstream on the side of Little River that has a pole in it.  If it is the same rock, that was quite
a powerful force that carried it that far downstream.  If I remember right, the rock is about the size of a small
car.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">By the way, the flood took place on July 24, 1985.  The streamflow for that day
was 53,800 CFS, the highest ever recorded on Little River.  This info is available at the </FONT><A HREF="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/al/nwis/peak?site_no=02399200&agency_cd=USGS&format=html"><FONT

     I also heard the story about a dam giving way somewhere upstream which certainly made the flooding worse than
what it already was.  The high water was originally caused by a very heavy thunderstorm over the area that dumped
several inches of rain in a short amount of time.  As you know, high water is not the norm for Little River during
that time of the year.</FONT></P>

your last. So, we removed the cables.
