<td>Ron on drop after Ricochet, we call this Gonzo Falls(long 
story).  See the submerged rock to his left?  This is what you've gotta miss, 
it's not hard with low water but at higher levels you wanna run closer to it 
to avoid the hole which gets really grabby at a foot and higher. Ron had a 
genuine near death, I'm coming to join you Ethel experience in this hole. 
At eleven inches and more you can run to the left of it</td>

just downstream</td>

<td>Ron on Funnel, a hard move at any level, just before Eye of the needle 
which leads into Bowdown.  These three are really one long Class V with many places to broach, pin, or 
just screw up</td>

<td>A Vest on Eye of the needle. The log was removed by Tony Robinson of Knoxville a few years 
ago, made the move a lot more fun, easier.  Tony also made the new gauge, the new ladder around the falls, removed the log in Freight Train 
(long rapid above Casey Jones), bolted safety ropes behind the falls, as well as cut many other logs on several occasions.

<td>Sloan on Bowdown around six to seven inches, riding high right in the "groove 
tube".  Water has eroded a groove in this rock, if you don't boof into the groove you 
go "bowdown"</td>
