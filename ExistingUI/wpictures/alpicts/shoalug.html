<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A certain C-1 paddler finally realizing
his longtime goal of running the put-in double waterfall.&nbsp; Looks like
I actually remembered to take the last stroke at the edge.&nbsp; The first
drop is run on far river right, on a smooth 45 degree slide somewhat obscured
by the tree. You can also see that the 'flat' rock between the drops is
just has a little bit of water pouring over it, signifying a nice level.&nbsp;
This is directly behind the BP station on Rt 240.&nbsp;</font></td>

point or you hit the barely submerged rock to river left.&nbsp; The best
way to enter is to catch the eddy on river left above this drop, but it
is highly recirculating and tough for the shorter boats to power into.&nbsp;
The aircraft carrier had no problem (there must be some reason I still
use it).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
